This month‚Äôs column features a Q&A with Team Netherlands manager Hensley Meulens, some recommended reading on baseball abroad and a few of the recent ins and outs on the World Baseball Classic rosters.</p><p>Robinson Can√≥ stood on deck at Estadio La Rinconada in Venezuela earlier this month and ate a heckling from the home fans.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The longtime Yankees and Mariners second baseman was a hired hand with Tigres del Licey in the Caribbean Series, the same team that <a href=#>knocked out his own squad</a>, Estrellas Orientales, in January‚Äôs Dominican League final. And now he, and the Tigres, were a win away from a record 11th Caribbean title, but on belligerent grounds.</p><p>Can√≥, now 40 years old with 17 major-league seasons behind him and a legend still growing, never turned around to face his hecklers. He spun his bat like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Iceman with a pen</a> in ‚ÄúTop Gun‚Äù and carried on.</p><p lang=es dir=ltr>De todo le gritan a Robinson Can√≥ desde las gradas del Estadio Monumental de Caracas üó£Ô∏è <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/moNSZHyorV</a></p><p>‚Äî S√©ptima Entrada (@septimaentrada_) <a href=#>February 11, 2023</a></p><p>Can√≥ may have lost a step or three ‚Äî he hit just .150 last season over 104 plate appearances between stops with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mets</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Padres</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Braves</a> ‚Äî but he has not lost his cool.</p><p>His vibe is valuable. That‚Äôs why, it seems, Can√≥ will be part of a stacked Dominican Republic roster when the World Baseball Classic starts in March. He‚Äôs without a job in <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Major League Baseball</a>, but he‚Äôs not without purpose.</p><p>‚ÄúI was born ready,‚Äù <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Can√≥ told a hoard of reporters</a> on the field in Venezuela after Tigres took down host Leones del Caracas in the 65th Caribbean Series‚Äô ‚ÄúGran Final.‚Äù With Can√≥ at second base, Licey became the most celebrated team among the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation, the league of leagues that oversees the historic series.</p><p>It seems Can√≥ will play out his days as a kind of mercenary veteran infielder. He was twice suspended by MLB for positive tests of performance-enhancing drugs, first for 80 games in 2018 with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mariners</a>, then for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">all of the 2021 season</a> while with the Mets. He is an eight-time All-Star, a World Series winner (in 2009 with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Yankees</a>), a two-time Silver Slugger and a Home Run Derby champ, all of which probably put him, before those two suspensions, on track for significant Hall of Fame consideration.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>He was a plus-side value add as recently as 2020, when he hit .316 with a 143 OPS+, according to Baseball Reference (43 percent better than league average). His 2022 season, though, saw a significant dip. He bounced between three teams last year in no small part because the Mets were paying most of his remaining salary. Can√≥ is still due $24 million this year, the final leg of a 10-year, $240 million deal he originally signed with the Mariners before the 2014 season.</p><p>‚ÄúHe is not the same player as he was in the past,‚Äù Licey manager Jos√© Offerman said before the Caribbean Series, ‚Äúbut he still is an above-average defender.‚Äù</p><p>In 2013, Can√≥ was named WBC MVP after going 15-for-32 at the plate, leading the Dominican to an undefeated run for the title. Next month‚Äôs WBC, Can√≥‚Äôs fourth, will allow him to showcase his skill for one final shot in the majors ‚Äì or serve as his farewell tour. The Dominican Republic opens the tournament on March 11 in Miami against Venezuela.</p><h2>Quick Q&A</h2><h3><strong>Hensley Meulens, WBC manager of Team Netherlands and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Colorado Rockies</a> hitting coach</strong></h3><p>‚ÄúBam Bam‚Äù Meulens won three World Series titles during his time as hitting coach with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Giants</a> from 2010-19. He was the first player born in Cura√ßao to play in the major leagues. He speaks five languages, including Papiamento, a creole dialect spoken in the Caribbean. He was even knighted by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 2012.</p><p>And next month, Meulens will manage the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic, his third time leading the Dutch in the WBC. Meulens has plenty of insight into the tourney ‚Äì the keys to taking advantage of a short tournament, getting a team ready to win and why he‚Äôs sick of hearing that the Netherlands is a ‚ÄúCinderella‚Äù team.</p><p>He spoke with The Athletic last week from Arizona, where he‚Äôs spending the first half of spring as the Rockies‚Äô hitting coach before flying to Taiwan for the start of the WBC.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Q&A lightly edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>What‚Äôs most difficult about managing in the WBC?</strong></p><p>First of all, it‚Äôs to get everybody who‚Äôs eligible to play on the team. And you don‚Äôt always get all of them. We don‚Äôt have all our big-league players. We‚Äôre missing three: <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kenley Jansen</a> (<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Red Sox</a>), <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ozzie Albies</a> (Braves) and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ceddanne Rafaela</a> (Red Sox minor leagues). When that happens, you find independent guys, amateur guys, whoever you can to play on the team. Even so, in the past, we found a way to compete every time. In 2006, we threw a no-hitter (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">18-year-old Shairon Martis against Panama</a>). It‚Äôs still the only no-hitter in WBC history. In 2009, we beat the Dominican twice and eliminated them. And the last two WBCs, we got to the semifinals. We always compete. We manage to pitch very well even though we don‚Äôt have a lot of major-league pitching. And we hit the crap out of the ball in 2017. I expect some of the same things. It‚Äôs all about getting the team to come together.</p><p>We‚Äôve been waiting six years for this one. We better be ready.</p><p><strong>It‚Äôs an odd tournament. Single games, no series. Pitchers will be limited. What‚Äôs the key to winning a tournament like this?</strong></p><p>We try to win every inning. Every game is do-or-die. There is no tomorrow. You want to win the bracket in the first round and face whoever you can in the quarterfinals. More than likely, that will be Japan or Korea when we advance to Tokyo. And Japan is the strongest. We‚Äôve beaten Korea twice, in 2013 and 2017. But if we‚Äôre gonna win, we have to beat everybody. That‚Äôs the challenge and that‚Äôs how you have to manage.</p><p>We played in the semifinals at Dodger Stadium in 2017. There were a lot of emotions flying around and we made some base-running mistakes in the first inning. Andrelton Simmons got caught in a rundown and Jurickson Profar stepped off the base at first and got tagged. And then Wladimir Balentien hit a homer that should have been a grand slam. Instead, it was a two-run homer and we lost by one.</p><p>You have to say to yourself, ‚ÄòWhat are we gonna do to not give up runs?‚Äô You have to make those tough decisions. I benched <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Xander Bogaerts</a> because he wasn‚Äôt swinging well. And that woke him up.</p><p><strong>Who are you most excited to see in the tournament?</strong></p><p>Cuba is allowing some of their big-league guys to play. It would have been great to see them all play, but it‚Äôll be great to see <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Luis Robert</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Yo√°n Moncada</a> (both <a class=ath_autolink href=#>White Sox</a>) playing for Cuba.</p><p><strong>Cura√ßao played well in the Caribbean Series. What do you think of Netherlands‚Äô chances in the WBC?</strong></p><p>Every time we advance, we‚Äôre a ‚ÄúCinderella.‚Äù We‚Äôre doing something right, right? So why are we a Cinderella? We‚Äôve shown three times we can beat the biggest countries. We eliminated Cuba. We eliminated Korea. We eliminated the Dominican; we beat them twice, with Big Papi (David Ortiz) in the lineup and Pedro (Mart√≠nez) pitching. We beat that team. I mean, c‚Äômon. You have to give our guys credit.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>We‚Äôve been in the Top 10 in the world for 20 years. That‚Äôs something for a country that‚Äôs known as a soccer country. Cura√ßao has a population of 100,000-something, but we keep producing players. We have six players from the majors. There‚Äôs talent floating around the island and in the Netherlands. We‚Äôll have Bogaerts (Padres), Profar (free agent), <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jonathan Schoop</a> (<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tigers</a>), and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chadwick Tromp</a> (Braves). We have Roger Bernadina at 38, Balentien at 38 and the Palacios brothers, Richie (<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Guardians</a>) and Josh (<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Pirates</a> minor leagues). We have guys who can play.</p><p>But that plane coming from Amsterdam, our players have to get acclimated right away. They‚Äôve only seen snow this winter.</p><h2>Just in time for Milan Fashion Week</h2><p>Tsuyoshi Shinjo, known with affinity among fans in Japan and North America as ‚ÄúBig Boss,‚Äù left the Mets in 2003 and returned to Nippon Professional Baseball to play for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. That fan affection followed him. And last year, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">took over as manager</a> of the Fighters.</p><p>On Tuesday, Shinjo stepped into another new realm, releasing a preview of the club‚Äôs alternate uniform after the Fighters put him in charge of designing its new look.</p><p>Here he is modeling the fit:</p><p lang=ja dir=ltr>„ÄêÁêÉÂõ£Áô∫Ë°®„Äë</p><p>Ôºè<br>„ÄéNEW AGE GAMES produced by SHINJO„ÄèÈñãÂÇ¨‚öæÔ∏è<br>Ôºº<a href=#>#Êñ∞Â∫ÑÂâõÂøó</a> Áõ£Áù£„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥„É¶„Éã„Éï„Ç©„Éº„É†„ÇíÁô∫Ë°®.·êü<br>‰∏ãË®òÊó•Á®ã Ë®à5Ë©¶Âêà„ÅßÈÅ∏Êâã„Åü„Å°„ÅåÁùÄÁî®„Åó„Å¶„Éó„É¨„Éº„Åó„Åæ„Åô‚ùóÔ∏è</p><p>üìÖ5Êúà13Êó•(Âúü)ÔΩû18Êó•(Êú®)<br>üèüES CON FIELD HOKKAIDO<a href=#>#lovefighters</a> <a href=#>#Êñ∞ÊôÇ‰ª£</a></p><p>‚ÄªÂÜôÁúü„ÅØÁêÉÂõ£Êèê‰æõ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eurOKn5lep</a></p><p>‚Äî „Éë„Éª„É™„Éº„Ç∞.com / „Éë„Éº„ÇΩ„É´ „Éë„Éª„É™„Éº„Ç∞TV„ÄêÂÖ¨Âºè„Äë (@PacificleagueTV) <a href=#>February 21, 2023</a></p><p>It‚Äôs certainly a choice.</p><h2>WBC ins and outs</h2><p>Pitching is taking a hit on WBC rosters even before the first game. As pitchers reported for spring training and their teams mapped out their health and potential progress over the next six weeks, the tournament, for some, became too much.</p><p>On Wednesday, right-hander <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nick Pivetta</a>, who started a league-high 33 games for the Red Sox last year, withdrew from Canada‚Äôs roster, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to Sportsnet.</a> Pivetta, along with Guardians righty <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cal Quantrill</a>, was meant to lead Canada‚Äôs rotation.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Last week, lefty <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Clayton Kershaw</a> <a href=#>removed himself from Team USA‚Äôs roster</a>. Kershaw, though, said he‚Äôs healthy enough. His issue, instead, was <a href=#>securing an insurance policy</a> to cover any potential injury he might suffer in the WBC. He was replaced on the Team USA roster by Padres swingman <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nick Martinez</a>.</p><p>Yankees lefty <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nestor Cortes</a> suffered a right hamstring strain early in camp and took himself off the U.S. roster. Rockies lefty <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kyle Freeland</a> took his place.</p><p>And Rockies right-hander <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Germ√°n M√°rquez</a>, who stood among Venezuela‚Äôs best pitchers, dropped out with a right hamstring strain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad and disappointed,‚Äù M√°rquez said last week.</p><h2>How do you say ‚Ä¶ ?</h2><p>In Dutch, a pitcher is called a ‚Äúwerper.‚Äù It‚Äôs pronounced with punch. ‚ÄúVare-per‚Äù with a little roll on the first syllable. On the Netherlands WBC roster, there are several minor-league werpers competing for the No. 1 job, along with 37-year-old former Braves right-hander Jair Jurrjens.</p><p>What about the other half of the battery? How do you say catcher in Dutch? It‚Äôs ‚Äúcatcher.‚Äù Easy enough.</p><h2>News and Notes</h2><p>‚Ä¢ Seung-hwan Oh carries not one, but two of the best nicknames in baseball‚Äôs recent history, known at various times as the ‚ÄúFinal Boss‚Äù and ‚ÄúStone Buddha.‚Äù And at 40 years old, he‚Äôs still kicking. He was the best reliever in KBO history when he joined the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cardinals</a> in 2016 for a four-year stint in MLB. When he returned to his original team, the Samsung Lions, in 2020, Oh became one of the KBO‚Äôs best relievers again.
