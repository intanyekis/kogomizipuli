Over the years, the publication hasn't quite shaken off its slightly smutty associations but it's moved into more serious journalism - alongside the gorgeous girls, of course - boasting interviews with public figures ranging from economists, novelists, and politicians to athletes, artists and film makers. Sine its inception, Playboy has gone from being a controversial top-shelf magazine to establishing itself as a global media fixture and an internationally recognized brand with a broad appeal. What started with nude pictures of the iconic Marilyn Monroe. The hype surrounding Marilyn’s nudity at that time was the ticket to success for Playboy with as much as 54,175 copies sold at the price of 50 cents each. Owing to their success in the very first season, art director Art Paul designed the distinctive rabbit ears and tuxedo bow tie logo, which has remained the Playboy symbol ever since. The November 1972 Playboy edition was the best-selling edition in the magazine's history with a record of 7.161,561 copies sold. Despite ongoing success in other realms, including television, the company hasn't been immune to the death of print media, with its net value slumping from $1 Billion in 2000 to $185 million in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the growth of the internet over the years, Playboy established their online presence with an official website for the magazine, playboy.com. In 1995, they developed a website called Playboy Cyber Club to encourage a more reciprocal dialogue with the readers. The digital form of magazine came into existence in 2005 and was made exclusive to Apple users.</p><p>Perhaps the most distinctive and most enduring of Playboy’s rituals (other than the legendary Mansion parties!) is the monthly Playmate selection. Each year, one Playboy model is selected to represent the calendar year - brining the lucky 'Playmate of the Month' a $25,000 bonus in the process. At the end of the calendar year, one Playmate becomes the Playmate of the year, netting herself an extra $100,000 and a car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The girls' profiles typically rise significantly when they become Playmates, and in the digital age there's almost no better way of discerning a celebrity's popularity than checking out their Twitter page. If a Playboy model is gaining popularity, she'll almost certainly gain 'followers' on Twitter, and it's almost guaranteed that there'll be a spike in followers following a Playmate's cover shoot. We've compiled a retrospective of the year in Playmates, and we've usefully ranked them in terms of their Twitter-popularity! #nsfw</p><h2 id=karina-marie---january-no-twitter-followers>10. Karina Marie - January (No twitter Followers)</h2><p>This gorgeous Playmate is the only one this year who hasn't yet entered the Twitterverse. Born in Basildon, in the UK, Karina Marie made her first appearance on television as a guest on the Channel 4 TV Show “The Salon”. At the age of 17 she graced her first magazine cover and since then she's featured on world-famous magazines like Arena, GQ and Elle. As January's Playmate she was quoted as saying that being in front of a camera gives her a buzz - and she doesn’t like wearing clothes at home! Apparently this British beauty is comfortable enough in a simple pair of knickers. We imagine her boyfriend isn't complaining...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kennedy-summers---december-1-771-twitter-followers>9.
