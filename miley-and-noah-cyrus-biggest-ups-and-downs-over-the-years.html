Noah made several appearances on the children’s show and had a small cameo in 2009’s Hannah Montana: The Movie. (Billy Ray and his ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Tish Cyrus</strong></a>, also share kids <a href=#>Brandi</a>, <a href=#>Trace</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Braison</a>. Billy Ray also shares son <a href=#>Christopher</a> with <strong>Kristin Luckey</strong>.)</p><p>While both went on to star in more TV and film projects — in addition to launching their successful music careers — Noah seemingly found it difficult to grow up in her sister’s shadow. “Being born in the family I was in, everybody gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley’s little sister,” she confessed <a href=#>during an Instagram Live</a> in May 2020.</p><p>Referring to her song “I’m Stuck,” Noah continued: “It was absolutely unbearable. And that’s why I write, ‘My sister’s like sunshine / Always bringing good light wherever she will go / And I was born to rain clouds / When they blew the flame out / Blessed in her shadows.’ Because, that’s why everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for more of Miley and Noah’s most notable sibling moments over the years:</p><h3>Early 2000s</h3><p>Noah made a handful of appearances throughout Hannah Montana’s four-season run on Disney Channel. She shared the screen with Miley again in Hannah Montana: The Movie as she can be spotted dancing throughout the musical number “Hoedown Throwdown.”</p><h3>August 2017</h3><p>One year after Noah launched her music career with her 2016 single “Make Me (Cry),” she appeared alongside Miley, their parents and siblings in an episode of <a href=#>Apple Music’s Carpool Karaoke.</a> The family hilariously donned mullet wigs to sing Billy Ray’s 1992 hit “Achy Breaky Heart.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Miley-Cyrus-and-Her-Sister-Noah-Cyrus-Biggest-Ups-and-Downs-Over-the-Years-2.jpg><h3>November 2018</h3><p>Miley <a href=#>celebrated her 26th birthday</a> surrounded by friends and family. In an Instagram Story video shared by Trace at the time, Noah can be seen singing “Happy Birthday” to her big sis with Tish and Miley’s then-fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a>.</p><h3>December 2018</h3><p>Noah fueled rumors that Miley and Hemsworth tied the knot by sharing an Instagram Story <a href=#>selfie of herself crying</a>. Many speculated that the pic was taken during the pair’s <a href=#>low-key wedding ceremony</a>. Miley confirmed her and the actor’s <a href=#>marital status</a> via Instagram days later. (Miley and Hemsworth <a href=#>split one year later</a> and <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in January 2020.)</p><h3>November 2019</h3><p>Noah and Tish joined Miley and then-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Cody Simpson</strong></a> for a <a href=#>family weekend</a>, which the former couple documented via their Instagram Stories. Noah, for her part, posted a video of Miley making the group buttered toast for breakfast via her own Instagram Story.</p><h3>April 2020</h3><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>TMRW</a> magazine, Noah opened up about being referred to as “Hannah Montana’s sister” growing up. “Somebody not even coming up to you and calling you by your name? That’s going to really f—k you up as a kid,” she revealed. “Make you feel, like, you don’t f—king even matter to the population — for them to not even know your name.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Miley-Cyrus-and-Her-Sister-Noah-Cyrus-Biggest-Ups-and-Downs-Over-the-Years-4.jpg><h3>August 2023</h3><p>Miley revealed in a video for her “Used to Be Young” <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> series that <a href=#>Noah was responsible</a> for snapping her infamous 2008 <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> topless portrait. “[Noah] was sitting on <strong>Annie’s [Leibovitz]</strong> lap and actually pushing the button on the camera, taking the pictures,” she stated.</p><p>The “Flowers” singer also noted that the pic marked the first time she wore red lipstick, a choice meant to distinguish her from her Hannah Montana persona.</p><h3>August 2023</h3><p>Rumors of a Cyrus family feud sparked after Noah and Braison <a href=#>skipped Tish’s wedding</a> to <a href=#><strong>Dominic Purcell</strong></a>. “My brother flew here to see me!! 🥹🫶,” Noah captioned an Instagram Story pic the same day as the ceremony. Miley, meanwhile, <a href=#>was in attendance</a> at the couple’s nuptials with Brandi and Trace and acted as one of Tish’s bridesmaids with Brandi.</p><p>Following the event, a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that “Tish will always love her kids no matter what” and that “She understands divorce might be challenging especially when she and Billy Ray had been together for so long.”</p><p>Billy Ray, for his part, moved on with singer <a href=#><strong>Firerose</strong></a> and the two <a href=#>wed in October 2023</a>. “[Tish is] sad the family are at odds over her and Billy Ray’s respective romances,” the insider added. “She’s trying not to give it too much energy and hopes it will ride itself out over time. It’s fairly established that Noah and Braidson have had a very tough time seeing their mom settle down with Dominic.”</p><p>However, reps for both Noah and Tish shut down the source’s claims in a statement to Us, stating the insider was not “anyone close to the family.” The Cyrus family rep continued: “The family is shocked and hurt by the false narrative taking shape on both social media and in the press and ask that everyone please respect their need for privacy at this time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Miley-Cyrus-and-Her-Sister-Noah-Cyrus-Biggest-Ups-and-Downs-Over-the-Years.jpg><h3>October 2023</h3><p>Amid speculation of a family feud, a clip resurfaced via <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> of Miley talking about Noah during her <a href=#>2020 interview</a> on the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Joe Rogan Experience” podcast</a>. In the video, Miley calls Noah’s EP The End of Everything “the most depressing EP you’ll ever listen to” because of her “emo” lyrics about growing up in Miley’s shadow.</p><p>“She has a song where she says, ‘My sister’s like sunshine and I’ll follow her wherever she goes, but I’m more like a rain cloud,’” Miley added. “You know, it’s like she really got this idea of me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After host <a href=#><strong>Joe Rogan</strong></a> suggested that Noah may need “to go to a doctor,” Miley responded, “She is. We’re all at the doctor a lot. … Yeah, she’s dealing with it. She’s dealing with it but she’s only 20, so I worry about her.”</p><p>Us reached out to Noah and Miley’s reps for comment at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZyaxm6tzZ1kp6eRnXqkxdGuqmaamZy0pr%2FTZqypq12Wu6V5w6iup6tdpMOmvoytn55lqZqus7%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmiley-and-noah-cyrus-biggest-ups-and-downs-over-the-years.html&text=Miley%20and%20Noah%20Cyrus%27%20Biggest%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Over%20the%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmiley-and-noah-cyrus-biggest-ups-and-downs-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmiley-and-noah-cyrus-biggest-ups-and-downs-over-the-years.html&title=Miley%20and%20Noah%20Cyrus%27%20Biggest%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmiley-and-noah-cyrus-biggest-ups-and-downs-over-the-years.html&title=Miley%20and%20Noah%20Cyrus%27%20Biggest%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmiley-and-noah-cyrus-biggest-ups-and-downs-over-the-years.html&title=Miley%20and%20Noah%20Cyrus%27%20Biggest%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmiley-and-noah-cyrus-biggest-ups-and-downs-over-the-years.html&description=Miley%20and%20Noah%20Cyrus%27%20Biggest%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sam-kantrow-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-wife-son-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Kantrow Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Son, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./juan-martin-del-potro-girlfriend-wife-dating-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Juan Martin del Potro Silent Girlfriend Rift!
