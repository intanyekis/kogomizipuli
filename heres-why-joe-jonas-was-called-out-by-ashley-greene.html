In reality, however, an awful lot of people wind up on really bad terms with someone they once had deep romantic feelings for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a regular person winds up having a bitter relationship with their ex, they can depend on a certain amount of privacy as they try to let their anger go. When a star gets involved in relationship drama, however, the world quickly learns about what is going on. For example, when <a href=#>Nicolas Cage split from his fourth wife only four days after they were wed</a>, his relationship strife garnered headlines.</p><p>Considering that the Jonas Brothers have been in the spotlight ever since they were youngsters, it would make sense if they knew how to avoid public drama. Unfortunately, it seems that isn’t the case, at least when it comes to Joe Jonas. After all, at one point Joe decided to blab about his private life in public and that resulted in the talented performer getting called out by his first lover.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RHOBH' Brandi Glanville Reveals Ex Husband's "Sleazy" Move During Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ask-me-anything>Ask Me Anything</h2><p>Throughout the Jonas Brothers’ time in the public eye, they have attracted many devoted fans who follow every aspect of their careers and personal life. As a result, there are people out there who can list <a href=#>every celebrity that each of the Jonas Brothers dated</a>. Despite how knowledgeable most Jonas Brothers fans are, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas took part in a Reddit AMA</a> in 2016, users came out of the woodwork with questions.</p><p>Throughout Joe Jonas’ Reddit AMA, the pop star proved to be extremely open with his fans. For example, Joe didn’t mince words when he was asked what <a href=#>the real reason the Jonas Brothers decided to split</a> was. After admitting that Nick was the one who pushed for the split, Joe spoke about feeling angry at his brother before basically admitting that it might have been time for a change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of addressing the rumors about the big split, Joe Jonas’ Reddit AMA revealed several more interesting tidbits. For example, Joe wrote that he was a fan of the way he was portrayed on South Park. Joe also wrote that he enjoys the “lonely Kevin” meme, his Camp Rock dancing makes him cringe, and that he got excited while filming the music video for DNCE’s “Body Moves. On the stranger side of things, Joe also addressed the size of Nick’s nipples and another topic that got him in hot water.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Camp Rock: 10 Throwback Pics That Make Us Miss The Franchise</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-goes-too-far>Joe Goes Too Far</h2><p>When Joe Jonas took place in the aforementioned 2016 Reddit AMA, he may have been under the impression that the name of those sessions is legally binding. After all, he really did seem to be willing to answer every question that fans posed to him. For example, if most stars had a fan ask who they lost their virginity to, they would ignore that question and move on. Instead of going that route, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe made the identity of his first lover very clear</a>.</p><p>"I lost my virginity to this girl named Ashley. You can probably just Google it. It's pretty easy to figure out. I dated a girl named Ashley, so just Google it to figure out which Ashley that is.” While it was amazing enough that Joe revealed who he lost his virginity to, he wasn’t done either. After all, Joe then went on to reveal the great lengths he went to in order to find protection at that moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Charlie Sheen Given The Side Eye As Soleil Moon Frye Says She Lost Her Virginity To Him</a></span></p><h2 id=ashley-rsquo-s-reaction>Ashley’s Reaction</h2><p>When people get romantically involved with celebrities, they more often than not have to cope with the tabloids and press invading their privacy. When Ashley Greene dated Joe Jonas, their relationship garnered a lot of attention from the press and fans alike. As a result, it seems likely that Greene became used to that kind of attention. However, given the fact that Joe and Ashley had a close relationship for a while, she should have been able to rest easy that he wouldn’t air their dirty laundry in public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Joe Jonas revealed that he lost his virginity to Ashley Greene, it didn’t take it long for the Twilight actor to respond. When some stars feel wronged by their peers, they take to social media to post a strongly worded message. Failing that, they seek out an interview where they can verbally unleash on the object of their anger. In this case, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green called Joe out</a> while also coming across as the classy one in the interaction. Almost immediately after the press started to cover Joe Jonas’ Reddit AMA, Ashley Greene took to Instagram and posted a simple image that read “class is timeless.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Joe Jonas, Emmy Rossum, And More Just Called Out A Hollywood Director's Really Bad Zoom Etiquette</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmoaidXZ%2B8r63SZq6aq12Yrq24xJ1kqK2kYq%2B6ecCsn6WdqWK0s7HEp5xo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-joe-jonas-was-called-out-by-ashley-greene.html&text=Here%27s%20Why%20Joe%20Jonas%20Was%20Called%20Out%20By%20His%20First%20Lover&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-joe-jonas-was-called-out-by-ashley-greene.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-joe-jonas-was-called-out-by-ashley-greene.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Joe%20Jonas%20Was%20Called%20Out%20By%20His%20First%20Lover" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-why-joe-jonas-was-called-out-by-ashley-greene.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Joe%20Jonas%20Was%20Called%20Out%20By%20His%20First%20Lover" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-joe-jonas-was-called-out-by-ashley-greene.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Joe%20Jonas%20Was%20Called%20Out%20By%20His%20First%20Lover" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-joe-jonas-was-called-out-by-ashley-greene.html&description=Here%27s%20Why%20Joe%20Jonas%20Was%20Called%20Out%20By%20His%20First%20Lover" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mitos-luxury-suites-lagos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mitos Luxury Suites , Lagos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./darren-barnets-shirtless-shots.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Darren Barnet's Shirtless Shots">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
