"I think that's a mistake."</p><p>In general, Elon said that executives who leave shares of their company to family simply on the basis of being related is problematic, especially when the individual isn’t passionate or skilled at taking on the responsibility.</p><p>Rather, Elon endorsed a “merit-based approach” that rewards people within the company who show initiative, regardless of if they’re blood relatives or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elon has a reported net worth of $234.3 billion and is behind a multitude of companies, including SpaceX, PayPal, Tesla, and Neuralink.</p><p>The billionaire’s <a href=#>relationship with his children remains much of a mystery</a>, including if any of his eldest have expressed interest in getting involved with his businesses. Elon shares a set of twins and triplets with his ex-wife Justin Justine Wilson, whom he was married to from 2000 to 2008. They also had an older son who died of SIDs in infancy.</p><p>He also has a son and a daughter with his on-and-off girlfriend Grimes, plus a set of twins he welcomed last year with a Neuralink executive, Shivon Willis.</p><p>In the past, Elon has said he maintains joint custody of his oldest children. But that may not be the current arrangement, as one of his children publicly declared she wanted nothing to do with him last year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When applying for a legal gender and name change, Vivian Wilson declared she wanted to distance herself from her father.</p><p>"Gender Identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,” she wrote in the court documents.</p><p>Elon later appeared to address his daughter’s public admission, but it didn’t give indication that he’s hopeful of repairing their relationship.</p><p>"It's full-on communism […] and a general sentiment that if you're rich, you're evil,"<a href=#> the Tesla CEO told Financial Times</a>. "It [the relationship] may change, but I have very good relationships with all the others [children]. Can't win them all."</p><p>Elon’s relationship with some, if not all of his kids, appears tenuous,and it may become even more complicated now that he’s publicly revealed he’s not leaving them any stakes.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Overwhelmed When Gifted Nicest Jewelry She’s Owned Since Paris Robbery</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Yahoo</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyrbvNZqSuq5tiwKLF0mafnmWnpLu1ecuemK%2BdXZ22tHnCqKSpmZ6esrR506hkmqapYryneceiqmZpYGKwqbXLnamepl8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2felon-musk-says-he-wont-leave-his-companies-to-any-of-his-10-children.html&text=Elon%20Musk%20Says%20He%20Wont%20Leave%20His%20Companies%20To%20Any%20Of%20His%2010%20Children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2felon-musk-says-he-wont-leave-his-companies-to-any-of-his-10-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2felon-musk-says-he-wont-leave-his-companies-to-any-of-his-10-children.html&title=Elon%20Musk%20Says%20He%20Wont%20Leave%20His%20Companies%20To%20Any%20Of%20His%2010%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2felon-musk-says-he-wont-leave-his-companies-to-any-of-his-10-children.html&title=Elon%20Musk%20Says%20He%20Wont%20Leave%20His%20Companies%20To%20Any%20Of%20His%2010%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2felon-musk-says-he-wont-leave-his-companies-to-any-of-his-10-children.html&title=Elon%20Musk%20Says%20He%20Wont%20Leave%20His%20Companies%20To%20Any%20Of%20His%2010%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2felon-musk-says-he-wont-leave-his-companies-to-any-of-his-10-children.html&description=Elon%20Musk%20Says%20He%20Wont%20Leave%20His%20Companies%20To%20Any%20Of%20His%2010%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mcu-character-did-timothy-chalamet-almost-play.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which MCU Character Did Timothee Chalamet Almost Play?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./brenda-strong-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brenda Strong - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
