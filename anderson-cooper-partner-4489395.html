The CNN anchor dated Benjamin, an NYC-based bar owner, from 2009 to 2018, during which they enjoyed what seemed to be a blissful relationship. And even after they broke up, the two stayed apart of each other’s lives in a major way: Benjamin has been helping Anderson raise son <strong>Wyatt Cooper</strong>, whom Anderson <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed via surrogate</a> in April 2020. Talk about friendly exes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But what are the ins and outs of their current relationship? And who has Anderson dated since their split? Find out where the duo stands today and what’s up with the CNN icon below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/benjamin-maisani-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed.jpg><h2>Benjamin and Anderson’s romance lasted 9 years.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Benjamin, a Hunter College grad, and Anderson Cooper’s romance began in 2009, though the circumstances of how they meant aren’t confirmed. The couple did not go public with their relationship until 2015, three years after Anderson came out as gay. Anderson and Benjamin made several public appearances together while they were dating and also enjoyed some vacations as a couple, including trips to Venice, Italy and Tahiti in 2017.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In March 2018, Anderson announced he split from Benjamin.<br>“Benjamin and I separated as boyfriends some time ago, we are still family to each other, and love each other very much,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Entertainment Tonight</i>.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/benjamin-maisani-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><h2></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>However, the NYC bar owner and the journalist have continued their journey and&nbsp;have been on great terms. In fact, Benjamin has been a co-parent to Anderson’s 1-year-old son <strong>Wyatt Cooper&nbsp;</strong>ever since the little one was born in April 2020. The two even still live together in the Big Apple raising baby Wyatt. “There is no acrimony between us,” Anderson told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;last year of his relationship with Benjamin. “Even though it’s maybe unconventional because he’s my ex, he is my family.” The political commentator added, “While we were a couple, he wasn’t sure he wanted kids, which was one of the issues we’d always had.&nbsp;But when I decided, ‘I’m just going to do this,’ he started to be interested.”</p><h2>Would they ever get back together?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>So would the exes ever get back together? That seems to be a definitive no. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> asked Anderson just that while she was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interviewing him</a> on her talk show in February 2021.&nbsp;“No, that’s not gonna happen!” Anderson confidently responded. However, Anderson did once again applaud his ex in the interview, saying that Benjamin “is such a great parent.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/benjamin-maisani-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed2.jpg><h2>Who is Anderson dating now?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>It’s unclear whether Anderson is currently dating someone else, though he has been linked to TV personality <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>. It’s a charge both parties, however, have denied. “What is it about Anderson Cooper that keeps you from falling in love with him?” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> asked during an episode of his show in January of 2022. “I just think it’s not what our relationship is based on,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a> host replied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“We’re just friends; that’s not a part of it. I think, at this point, we know each other too well. We’re not attracted to each other in that way.”&nbsp;While he admitted that Anderson is “a handsome guy,” he added that, “we’re not in that place.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The BFFs explained in a joint interview how the rumors may have started. Though they admitted they’d been set up for a blind date back in the 90s, it never happened. “I knew within 45 seconds, I was never going on a date with&nbsp;Andy Cohen,” Anderson hilariously told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> during<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a 2017 appearance</a> on The Tonight Show&nbsp;of their first meeting.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I imagined him in like a Bluetooth headset, gesticulating,” he added. “He was all excited, and he violated my cardinal rule, which is he asked me about my mom within the first minute of talking to me.” Andy exclaimed, “I wanted to date the Vanderbilt boy! I was excited.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Distractify</a>, Anderson has also been linked romantically to a Dallas radiologist named <strong>Victor Lopez.&nbsp;</strong>They reportedly started dating early in 2018, but had parted ways by the end of that same year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Cnm56qo6S7bq%2FOqKeeql2lrrPAzZ6pZmxkbYZ0hZRo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanderson-cooper-partner-4489395.html&text=5%20Things%20On%20Anderson%20Coopers%20Former%20Partner%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanderson-cooper-partner-4489395.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanderson-cooper-partner-4489395.html&title=5%20Things%20On%20Anderson%20Coopers%20Former%20Partner%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanderson-cooper-partner-4489395.html&title=5%20Things%20On%20Anderson%20Coopers%20Former%20Partner%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanderson-cooper-partner-4489395.html&title=5%20Things%20On%20Anderson%20Coopers%20Former%20Partner%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanderson-cooper-partner-4489395.html&description=5%20Things%20On%20Anderson%20Coopers%20Former%20Partner%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anthony-ramos-bio-wiki-age-height-weight-dating-ethnicity-religion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anthony Ramos Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Ethnicity, Religion">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./susan-necheles-wikipedia-and-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Susan Necheles | Wikipedia And Husband">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
