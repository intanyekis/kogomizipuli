She's starred in critical hits, as well as blockbuster series, including the Aquaman franchise that helped cement Mamoa's superstardom.</p><p>The relationship between Momoa and Heard has been a topic of interest for many fans and media outlets. As two prominent Hollywood actors, their union is undoubtedly under the microscope of public scrutiny. The media has always shown a keen interest in celebrity relationships, and in recent times, this relationship seems to have intensified.</p><h2 id=did-jason-momoa-and-amber-heard-know-each-other-before-filming-aquaman>Did Jason Momoa And Amber Heard Know Each Other Before Filming Aquaman?</h2><p>There is a lot of speculation that Momoa was friends with Johnny Depp and Heard long before any of the actors entered the DC Cinematic Universe. Momoa had followed both the actors on Twitter and Instagram long before that point and still does so to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to the making of Aquaman, Heard and Momoa had plenty of shared experiences. The two actors spent months on set together, filming scenes both on land and underwater.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Aquaman-Jason-Momoa-Justice-League-Snyder-Cut.jpg><p>From training for their fight scenes to bonding over practical jokes, Heard and Momoa's friendship was strengthened by their time on set.</p><p>One particularly memorable experience for the duo was filming the underwater scenes. Both actors had to undergo extensive training in order to be able to perform in these challenging conditions. They worked with a team of stunt coordinators and trainers who helped them learn how to hold their breath for extended periods of time and move gracefully through the water.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it wasn't just hard work that brought these two together on set. They also enjoyed playing practical jokes on each other during downtime between takes. One particularly memorable prank involved Momoa stealing Heard's phone and using it to take silly photos of himself making funny faces. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Another was when Momoa ripped pages out of books</a> Heard would read when suspended in mid-air. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Heard would be annoyed by some of these pranks</a>, but it was all in good fun.</p><p>Their first joint appearance was in 2017 when they attended the premiere of Justice League in London. The pair looked stunning as they walked down the red carpet, posing for pictures and interacting with fans. Their easy camaraderie was evident as they joked around with each other, clearly enjoying each other's company.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Are Amber Heard And Brie Larson Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Heard and Momoa have continued to show up at various events together. In 2018, they attended CinemaCon in Las Vegas to promote Aquaman.</p><p>They took part in a panel discussion alongside director James Wan where they shared insights into their experiences making the movie. It was clear from their interactions that they had developed a deep respect for one another both professionally and personally.</p><h2 id=jason-momoa-fought-for-amber-heard-to-come-back-for-aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom>Jason Momoa Fought For Amber Heard To Come Back For Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom</h2><p>The highly anticipated sequel to the 2018 blockbuster Aquaman is currently in production, and fans are eagerly awaiting news about the film. <a href=# rel=nofollow>It's confirmed to be tackling climate change</a>, and Ben Affleck is rumored to be returning for the movie. Fans are also curious about the rest of the involved cast.</p><p>One of the burning questions on everyone's mind is whether or not Heard will return as Mera, the queen of Atlantis and love interest of Momoa's Arthur Curry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The decision to keep Heard on board has sparked heated debates among fans and industry professionals alike. Some argue that she should be held accountable for her alleged actions and removed from the film entirely. Others maintain that she should be given a fair chance to continue in her role as Mera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jason-momoa-turned-down-a-franchise-worth-1-6-billion-because-he-didn-t-want-to-take-his-shirt-off-throughout-the-film.jpg><p>One idea that gained traction after a petition calling for Heard's removal from Aquaman 2 gained over 1 million signatures. The petition cites both the abuse allegations and Heard's involvement in a high-profile court case against former business managers as reasons why she should not be allowed to continue playing Mera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, some have pointed out that recasting Mera could create continuity issues within the franchise. After all, she played a significant role in the first film and was expected to have an even larger part in its sequel. Additionally, replacing an actor mid-franchise is always a risky move as it can alienate fans who have grown attached to a particular portrayal of a character.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">According to Los Angeles Times</a>, Heard will appear in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair then reported that Momoa actually fought for Heard to come back in the Aquaman sequel</a>, further leading fans to believe that the two are pretty close friends.</p><p>However, events that occurred during the Heard-Depp trial have led some fans to believe the exact opposite.</p><p>​​​​​</p><h2 id=did-jason-momoa-testify-during-the-amber-heard-johnny-depp-trial>Did Jason Momoa Testify During The Amber Heard-Johnny Depp Trial?</h2><p>The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial has been one of the most controversial and highly publicized cases in recent years. The iconic Hollywood actor has been accused of several heinous crimes by his ex-wife, Heard, which has resulted in a lengthy legal battle that has attracted the attention of millions around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Losing The Johnny Depp Trial Changed Amber Heard's Lawyers' Careers Forever</a></span></p><p>Momoa's potential involvement in the case stems from his friendship with Heard. Many wondered if he would testify on behalf of his friend or if he had any information that could help clear her name. Despite rumors circulating online, Momoa seems to not have testified during the trial. However, nothing has been confirmed or denied officially by any of the celebrities involved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-2023-02-20-7-51-53-am.png><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">According to StyleCaster, Momoa has taken to his social media</a> accounts to show his opinions on the matter. He apparently liked an Instagram post from both Depp and Heard that publicly let the world know what they were fighting for in court. It appears Momoa's friendship with both parties still remains intact despite the drama that has unfolded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Momoa's potential involvement in the case, it remains unclear whether he actually testified or not. However, his connection to Heard through their work on "Aquaman" adds an interesting dynamic to the story. Regardless of whether he was involved in the trial, his presence serves as a reminder that even those who are not directly involved can still have an impact on high-profile cases like this one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYppqVp3qpscCrm2aZnpl6q63SqKVmpZGivKJ50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZJudlqS%2FpnnSrZirqpmjtG61zWaYqq2Roq6vedOonp6smJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famber-heard-and-jason-mamoa-relationship-before-starring-in-aquaman-together.html&text=Amber%20Heard%20And%20Jason%20Momoa%20Had%20A%20Complicated%20Relationship%20Long%20Before%20Working%20On%20Aquaman%20Together%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famber-heard-and-jason-mamoa-relationship-before-starring-in-aquaman-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famber-heard-and-jason-mamoa-relationship-before-starring-in-aquaman-together.html&title=Amber%20Heard%20And%20Jason%20Momoa%20Had%20A%20Complicated%20Relationship%20Long%20Before%20Working%20On%20Aquaman%20Together%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famber-heard-and-jason-mamoa-relationship-before-starring-in-aquaman-together.html&title=Amber%20Heard%20And%20Jason%20Momoa%20Had%20A%20Complicated%20Relationship%20Long%20Before%20Working%20On%20Aquaman%20Together%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famber-heard-and-jason-mamoa-relationship-before-starring-in-aquaman-together.html&title=Amber%20Heard%20And%20Jason%20Momoa%20Had%20A%20Complicated%20Relationship%20Long%20Before%20Working%20On%20Aquaman%20Together%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famber-heard-and-jason-mamoa-relationship-before-starring-in-aquaman-together.html&description=Amber%20Heard%20And%20Jason%20Momoa%20Had%20A%20Complicated%20Relationship%20Long%20Before%20Working%20On%20Aquaman%20Together%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jake-paul-julia-rose-back-together-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Paul and Julia Rose Back Together  They Never Broke Up">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./all-the-ways-jennifer-lopezs-marry-me-mimics-her-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All the Ways Jennifer Lopez's 'Marry Me' Mimics Her Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
