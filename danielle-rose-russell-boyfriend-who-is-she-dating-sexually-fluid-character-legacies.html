However, in reality, people have admitted for decades that there is something very sensual about vampires. In fact, <a href=#>a major celebrity is one record stating “vampires are sexy”</a>. With all of that in mind, it makes sense that over the last couple of decades, there has been a lot of vampire media that has been produced with teen audiences in mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the massive success of the Twilight films, it made sense that The CW wanted to attract the same kind of audience that lined up to see those movies. Fortunately for the powers that be at that television network, when The Vampire Diaries debuted on television in 2009, the show would go on to be a massive success. In fact, the show became such a sensation that there are millions of fans who want to know <a href=#>what went on behind the scenes of The Vampire Diaries</a>. On top of that, the series has spawned several spin-off shows including Legacies. Ever since Danielle Rose Russell began headlining the show Legacies, fans have become obsessed with her and her love life for a couple of reasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Nina Dobrev's And Ian Somerhalder's Net Worths Compare Since 'The Vampire Diaries' Ended</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danielle-rose-russell-rsquo-s-famous-legacies-character-stands-out>Danielle Rose Russell’s Famous Legacies Character Stands Out</h2><p>At one time in the past, there were only a handful of television networks in existence and gaining access to the kind of equipment needed to make a movie was out of reach for the vast majority of people. For those reasons, there were a handful of people who were able to control the vast majority of movies and TV shows that were widely released to the masses.</p><p>With such a small group of people able to wield almost complete control over the film and television landscapes, only certain kinds of stories were told. For example, pretty much every film made throughout history has starred straight white characters. Thankfully, in recent years that has slowly begun to change largely because more people can make movies and shows than at any other time in the past. Despite that, it still is truly remarkable that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle Rose Russell’s Legacies character is “sexually fluid”</a> especially because she is the series’ main antagonist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that it has been so rare for people in the LGBTQ+ community to see themselves reflected on the big or little screen, Danielle Rose Russell’s Legacies character represents something important. On top of that, Legacies fans have learned that series lead Danielle Rose Russell was passionate about wanting her character to be “sexually fluid” to have more representation in media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, given the fact that Danielle Rose Russell is an actor, she should be able to play a role even if the character is different than her in some important ways. Despite that, it is common for television and movie fans to want the actors who play their favorite characters to have a lot in common with the person they are portraying. For example, many people are overjoyed when they learn actors who played a couple onscreen are dating in real life. Similarly, it makes sense that since Rusell playing a “sexually fluid” lead character in a mainstream show is a watershed moment, many fans want to know if she is open like that in her personal life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Co-Stars Who Fell In Love On The Set Of A Comedy</a></span></p><h2 id=danielle-rose-russell-and-her-love-life-remains-an-enigma>Danielle Rose Russell And Her Love Life Remains An Enigma</h2><p>Throughout human history, the anonymous masses have always wanted to learn more about the rich and famous people in the world. However, in the olden days, people could only rely on books or second-hand tales to learn about the most famous folks. Then, with the advent of TVs and magazines, fans were able to find out a lot more about their favorite stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, people can interact with a lot of stars on a lot more personal level, to say the very least. After all, loads of celebrities seem to share their every thought and post photos of their private lives on social media. In fact, some stars are so addicted to social media that they came crawling back after they tried to quit. On top of that, there have been <a href=#>many notable stars who’ve agreed to star in “reality” shows</a> at one time or another. For all of those reasons, fans know more about the vast majority of stars than at any other time in the past.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Quit Social Media...And Then Came Back</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that so many stars are incredibly open about their personal lives these days, a lot of fans have seemingly come to believe that celebrities owe them a window into their inner world. For that reason, a lot of fans have been shocked to learn that Legacies star Danielle Rose Russell clearly isn’t overly interested in letting them into her private world. Sure, there are some fascinating facts that people know about Russell but when it comes to her love life, Danielle is a total enigma. Of course, that only serves to make a lot of fans want to know if she is dating someone, and how that theoretical person identifies, even more.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Sad Truth About Danielle Rose Russell’s Weight Loss</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrmtsYyrpqydXafCtL%2FEpaNmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZq%2BYpHqqv4ysn55llJbBqrrGZqqesKWWua3FjJ%2BjrqGUYrCprdGamq2domK5prPAnKCeq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdanielle-rose-russell-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating-sexually-fluid-character-legacies.html&text=The%20Real%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Obsessed%20With%20Whether%20Or%20Not%20Danielle%20Rose%20Russell%20Is%20Dating%20Anyone&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdanielle-rose-russell-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating-sexually-fluid-character-legacies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdanielle-rose-russell-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating-sexually-fluid-character-legacies.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Obsessed%20With%20Whether%20Or%20Not%20Danielle%20Rose%20Russell%20Is%20Dating%20Anyone" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdanielle-rose-russell-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating-sexually-fluid-character-legacies.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Obsessed%20With%20Whether%20Or%20Not%20Danielle%20Rose%20Russell%20Is%20Dating%20Anyone" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdanielle-rose-russell-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating-sexually-fluid-character-legacies.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Obsessed%20With%20Whether%20Or%20Not%20Danielle%20Rose%20Russell%20Is%20Dating%20Anyone" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdanielle-rose-russell-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating-sexually-fluid-character-legacies.html&description=The%20Real%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Obsessed%20With%20Whether%20Or%20Not%20Danielle%20Rose%20Russell%20Is%20Dating%20Anyone" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./billie-jean-king-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie Jean King Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ngala-lodge-bakau-gambia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ngala Lodge, Bakau, Gambia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
