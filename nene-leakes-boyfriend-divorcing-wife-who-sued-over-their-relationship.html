The soon-to-be exes have been married since 2016 and have one child together, but Nyonisela listed their separation date as September 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rod Stewart Refused $1 Million To Perform In Qatar</a></span></p><p>Not only have they lived separately, but Nyonisela says they haven’t been intimate since their break-up in 2021. Based on this timeline, it appears Nyonisela is suggesting his marriage was over before he started dating Nene, which poses a problem for his wife’s ongoing lawsuit against them.</p><p>In June, it was reported that Malomine filed a lawsuit against Nene and Nyonsiela, claiming that their relationship led to the dissolution of her marriage to her husband.</p><p>She claims that Nene’s social media use further exacberated the situation, describing it as painful to see her husband on the reality star’s profiles.</p><p>Malomine, who filed the lawsuit in North Carolina, is seeking at least $100,000 in damages from the pair. North Carolina is 1 of 7 American states that allows people to be sued for adultery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nena and Nyonsiela were first linked in December 2021, shortly after the Real Housewives alum’s husband Gregg Leakes had passed away from colon cancer. The couple were married from 1997 to 2011 and then from 2013 to his death in 2021.</p><p>"She can't stop smiling around Nyonisela. It's still very new but she's almost like a teenager with him, just light and giggly and feeling those new relationship butterflies," a source told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a> .</p><p>They continued, "It was obviously very hard for NeNe after Gregg's death, but she had been his caretaker for so long, she really lost what it was like to have a partner who prioritizes you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s unclear what will happen to Malomine’s lawsuit now that her estranged husband is claiming he didn’t start a romantic relationship with Nene until after he left his wife.</p><p>Aside from the conflict with her boyfriend’s ex, Nene is also engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with The Real Housewives of Atlanta producers for a toxic workplace and discrimination, which she publicly launched in April.</p><p>Nene claims the producers didn’t shield her from co-star Kim Zolciak’s mistreatment, despite being fully aware. She’s now seeking undisclosed damages and has permanently left the Bravo show.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jeff Bezos Gives Dolly Parton $100 Million Award For Courage & Civility</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS7prrEZqOemZuawG6uzrKdq6GVo7FusMivpqubmaO0bsPIn5xmr5ikerTBxJ1kqK6Vp3q1tMSiqWaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnene-leakes-boyfriend-divorcing-wife-who-sued-over-their-relationship.html&text=NeNe%20Leakes%20Boyfriend%20Divorcing%20Wife%20Who%20Sued%20Over%20Their%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnene-leakes-boyfriend-divorcing-wife-who-sued-over-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnene-leakes-boyfriend-divorcing-wife-who-sued-over-their-relationship.html&title=NeNe%20Leakes%20Boyfriend%20Divorcing%20Wife%20Who%20Sued%20Over%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnene-leakes-boyfriend-divorcing-wife-who-sued-over-their-relationship.html&title=NeNe%20Leakes%20Boyfriend%20Divorcing%20Wife%20Who%20Sued%20Over%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnene-leakes-boyfriend-divorcing-wife-who-sued-over-their-relationship.html&title=NeNe%20Leakes%20Boyfriend%20Divorcing%20Wife%20Who%20Sued%20Over%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnene-leakes-boyfriend-divorcing-wife-who-sued-over-their-relationship.html&description=NeNe%20Leakes%20Boyfriend%20Divorcing%20Wife%20Who%20Sued%20Over%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-cast-of-orange-is-the-new-black-up-to-in-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is The Cast Of Orange Is The New Black Up To In 2022?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./252278-nanny-faye-76-decided-learn-some-burlesq-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nanny Faye, 76, Decided to Learn Some Burlesque Moves with Sister Frances to Get in Shape">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
