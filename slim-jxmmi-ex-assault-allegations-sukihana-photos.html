Reports suggested Jxmmi had been abusive towards Kee for some time, but she declined to press charges “out of fear that he would retaliate against her.”</p><p>Almost two years later, those allegations have resurfaced after Slim Jxmmi was photographed getting up close and personal with Sukihana in a series of photos shared to the latter’s Instagram page on Wednesday (February 22).</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>One picture shows the Love & Hip Hop: Miami star grinding on the SremmLife rapper inside a car park, while another finds her hugging him and holding his face as he clasps her exposed butt cheeks.</p><p>“Ask Jimmi how much he paid for my hair appointment today,” Sukihana wrote in her caption, implying the Mississippi rapper had treated her by covering the cost of her elaborate bun hairstyle.</p><p>Shortly after, Kee responded by sharing Sukihana’s post on her Instagram Stories while referencing Slim Jxmmi’s alleged 2020 assault.</p><p>“Y’all keep sending me this. they posted it for a reason,” she wrote. “This is the most attention he’s gotten since <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>SremmLife 2</a> and knocking my teeth back.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a follow-up Story, Kee wrote: “He’s blocked for a reason. people do not change. had to learn to stop feeling bad and making excuses for how he treats me. I love myself, my son and my PH balance more.</p><p>“I wish them the best though. this is the attention he needs for <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Sremm4</a>[.] y’all go get that in April lol.”</p><p>Sukihana clapped back via her own Instagram Stories, posting a photo of her flashing a smile with one of her front teeth missing accompanied by the message: “Mines already out.”</p><p>The “Yous a Hoe” rapper took another shot at Kee in a comment on The Shade Room‘s Instagram post, writing: “Girl ain’t nobody sent u that.”</p><p>“Lmao, he was just on my story trying to play family three weeks ago. now why wouldn’t my friends, family and followers send me that [crying face emoji],” Kee responded in an IG Story.”don’t be delusional. and I don’t follow you my love.</p><p>“He told me months ago y’all are friends and you’re not his type. and it’s all fun. so I don’t know why I’m even taking this serious lord.”</p><p>Sukihana responded: “Stop thinking these [ninja emoji] don’t love a lil chocolate they do!”</p><p>She then posted a photo of her striking a suggestive pose and wrote: “Girl you don’t know what is type is he said he ain’t got one,” referencing Rae Sremmurd’s 2014 hit “No Type.”</p><p>After seemingly facing accusations of colorism, Kee wrote back: “Lord y’all are so offended in my DMs mad about what I said about [Slim Jxmmi] telling me that girl is not his type. I was not coming at her IN NO WAY and either was he. lmfao I’m relaying what he said to me and I was responding to her.</p><p>“Y’all have to relax and stop making everything about color[.] I’m black too. he loves darkskin women and so do I. she’s thick. he weighs 100 pounds.. that’s it.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Shade Room</a> shed more light on Slim Jxmmi and Kee’s turbulent relationship, claiming the couple “got back together after an eight-month long separation,” during which Jxmmi “went to therapy to become a changed man for their family.”</p><p>“Just a few weeks ago, he was allegedly caught cheating on [Kee] causing the couple to separate once again,” the outlet added. “Sources say [Kee] is embarrassed by his actions in public after claiming he wanted to bring his family back together.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Kee came forward with more accusations against Slim Jxmmi in January 2022 when he was <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>arrested for allegedly attacking her during a domestic dispute in Miami</a>.</p><p>According to police, Jxmmi knocked down a door, pulled out her hair extensions and threw her phone away after she questioned him about a woman he was following on Twitter.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/08/slim-jxmmi-arrested-lax-georgia-drug-case-250x142.png alt="Rae Sremmurd’s Slim Jxmmi Arrested At LAX Over Georgia Drug Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Rae Sremmurd’s Slim Jxmmi Arrested At LAX Over Georgia Drug Case</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>August 9, 2022</p></a><p>However, Kee later claimed Jxmmi didn’t actually put hands on her and accused Dade County police of lying about what happened.</p><p>“Dade County y’all are wrong for this,” she wrote on Instagram. “I told you guys he did not hit me. Every officer you guys had in my face are wrong for this. No hands were put on anybody, I stated it more than once.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“It was a loud argument and the police were called. You guys turn nothing into something. It’s our sons first birthday tomorrow, what’s wrong with y’all?”</p><p>The <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>battery case was dropped the following month</a> after Kee recanted her story and refused to cooperate with authorities, leaving prosecutors with little chance of proving the allegations against Slim Jxmmi.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miqpaGdYre5ucyiZJ6wXZbAtK3UpatmmZyhsqit06Kmp6tdqMKstceapZploJ28tbvS</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fslim-jxmmi-ex-assault-allegations-sukihana-photos.html&text=Slim%20Jxmmi%27s%20Ex%20Rehashes%20Assault%20Allegations%20After%20Sukihana%20Photos&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fslim-jxmmi-ex-assault-allegations-sukihana-photos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fslim-jxmmi-ex-assault-allegations-sukihana-photos.html&title=Slim%20Jxmmi%27s%20Ex%20Rehashes%20Assault%20Allegations%20After%20Sukihana%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fslim-jxmmi-ex-assault-allegations-sukihana-photos.html&title=Slim%20Jxmmi%27s%20Ex%20Rehashes%20Assault%20Allegations%20After%20Sukihana%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fslim-jxmmi-ex-assault-allegations-sukihana-photos.html&title=Slim%20Jxmmi%27s%20Ex%20Rehashes%20Assault%20Allegations%20After%20Sukihana%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fslim-jxmmi-ex-assault-allegations-sukihana-photos.html&description=Slim%20Jxmmi%27s%20Ex%20Rehashes%20Assault%20Allegations%20After%20Sukihana%20Photos" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-jerry-seinfelds-exes-from-the-show-look-like-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Jerry Seinfeld's Exes From The Show Look Like Today">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./selma-blair-ms-chemo-treatment-updates-insomnia-shaved-head-scab.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Selma Blair MS Chemo Treatment Updates: Insomnia, Shaved Head, Scab">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
