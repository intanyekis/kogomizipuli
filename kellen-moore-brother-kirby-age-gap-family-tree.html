Their dad, Tom, was a football coach at Prosser High School and always encouraged them to play the game.</p><p>Consequently, the Moore brothers played high school football under their dad’s guidance in their teens. Among them, Kellen played professional football after college, but it was a brief career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/American-Professional-Football-Coach-Kellen-Moore-1.jpg><p>Kellen Christopher Moore, better known as Kellen Moore, is an American former football player turned coach. He currently works as an offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers of the NFL.</p><p>Before his coaching career, Kellen’s professional football was around for six years. After graduating college in 2011, <a href=# rel=noopener>the quarterback</a> declared for the NFL draft, but no clubs picked him. However, he signed with the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent in 2012.</p><p>Following this, Moore only played three games in his entire NFL career and eventually announced his retirement from playing career in 2018.</p><p>However, Kellen is much more successful as a coach. Before being with the Chargers, he served as quarterback coach and offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys.</p><h2>Kellen Moore Brother Kirby Moore: Age Gap Between Brothers And Family</h2><p>Kellen Moore’s younger brother, Kirby Moore, was born to his parents, Tom and Kris Moore, in 1991 in Prosser, Washington. He is only around three years younger than his older brother, Kellen.</p><p>Growing up in Prosser, the Moore brothers began playing football from a young age, influenced by their dad.</p><p>Tom Moore had been a head coach for the Prosser HS boy’s football team for years and often took his boys with him to the ground when they did not have classes. Over time, they became proficient in football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kellen-Moores-Younger-Brother-Kirby-e1696853741184.jpg><p>Speaking more of Kirby, he played both basketball and football for his high school team. Although he was a three-year letter-winner in basketball, his first choice was football, and he eventually opted for a football career.</p><p>While at Prosser, Kirby was named first-team all-conference for his last three seasons. At the end of his school career, he had 304 receptions for 4909 yards and 95 touchdowns.</p><p>Kirby later <a href=# rel=noopener>played college football for the Boise State Broncos</a> until 2013.</p><p>After obtaining a degree in Communications, he started his coaching career, joining the College of Idaho as their wide receiver coach in 2014.</p><p>He is currently an offensive coordinator and quarterback coach for the Missouri Tigers.</p><h2>Kellen And His Wife Are Parents Of Three Kids</h2><p>The L.A. Chargers offensive coordinator, Kellen Moore, is married to his longtime girlfriend, Julie Wilson. Together, they have three kids- a son and two daughters.</p><p>Hailing from the same place, Kellen and Julie met while attending Prosser High School, where Kellen was two years her senior.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kellen-Moore-And-His-Wife-Julie.jpg><p>After dating for years, the pair finally tied the knot on July 23, 2011, in the presence of their close friends and relatives. The wedding was held at St. Regis Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah.</p><p>Around three years after their marriage, Julie gave birth to their first son, Kyler. Moreover, they later welcomed their daughters, Halle and Madelyn Moore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC3xKWjnqZdorywvsRmmaunpJ2ys3nKoqmbsV2WtKZ5xpqnZp6RoratxYytqZ6dXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkellen-moore-brother-kirby-age-gap-family-tree.html&text=Age%20Gap%20And%20Family%20Tree&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkellen-moore-brother-kirby-age-gap-family-tree.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkellen-moore-brother-kirby-age-gap-family-tree.html&title=Age%20Gap%20And%20Family%20Tree" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkellen-moore-brother-kirby-age-gap-family-tree.html&title=Age%20Gap%20And%20Family%20Tree" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkellen-moore-brother-kirby-age-gap-family-tree.html&title=Age%20Gap%20And%20Family%20Tree" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkellen-moore-brother-kirby-age-gap-family-tree.html&description=Age%20Gap%20And%20Family%20Tree" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./billie-lourd-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie Lourd Net Worth  How Much is Billie Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tiktok-star-addison-rae-breaks-her-silence-on-pregnancy-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikTok Star Addison Rae Breaks Her Silence on Pregnancy Rumors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
