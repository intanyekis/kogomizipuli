Love him or hate him, the man makes for good TV. While on the small screen, the chef has <a href=#>dealt with insane owners</a>, nearly gotten <a href=#>into physical altercations</a>, and has even had <a href=#>lawsuits levied against him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this has helped him thrive for years now.</p><p>Prior to being on TV, the acclaimed chef was mastering the restaurant industry, and these days, he owns countless eateries. Fans want to go and see what the fuss is about, but they'd like to know how much it's going to run them.</p><p>Let's take a look a Chef Ramsay and how much it costs to eat at one of his establishments.</p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay-is-a-superstar-chef>Gordon Ramsay Is A Superstar Chef</h2><p>As arguably the most famous chef in the world, Chef Gordon Ramsay needs little introduction. The man has seen and done it all in the world of food, and his TV shows have made his a household name.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Ramsay is currently worth an astounding $220 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He typically earns around $45 million per year from his media and restaurant empire. Between June 2017 and June 2018, Gordon earned north of $60 million. Between June 2018 and June 2019 he earned $65 million. In mid-July 2019 Gordon sold a 50% stake in his North American holding company to Lion Capital. Lion plans to spend $100 million launching 100 Gordon Ramsay restaurants in the United States between 2020 and 2025," the site details about his notable salaries.</p><p>His shows alone are more than enough to keep his bank accounts overflowing. He makes a ton of money per episode for each of them, and thanks to their sustained success, he can keep cashing those checks for as long as he desires. Granted, he did prematurely end one show, but we don't envision him doing that again.</p><p>Being a TV star is largely what makes Ramsay his fortune, but none of it would be possible without the work that he's done in the restaurant game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Gordon Ramsay Is Tougher On Hell’s Kitchen Than Master Chef</a></span></p><h2 id=ramsay-has-amazing-restaurants>Ramsay Has Amazing Restaurants</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, "Gordon Ramsay is the second-richest chef in the world, owns 35 restaurants, and is known for his colorful word choices on many TV shows.</p><p>He's owned plenty more through the years, but many of his previous ones have since closed their doors. Nevertheless, owning and operating over 30 restaurants is no easy feat, but it's just another day at the office for Chef Ramsay.</p><p>A unique thing about his restaurants is that they vary in quality. Some have several Michelin stars, signifying that they are among the best in the land. Others, however, do not, but the lack of Michelin stars does not diminish the fact that they are known for serving exceptional meals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given his popularity, many people want nothing more than to visit one of Chef Ramsay's restaurants. Since you're paying for quality food, you'd better believe that you'll be paying the price once the bill is due.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gordon Ramsay Makes His Kids Follow These Over-The-Top Rules</a></span></p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay-39-s-restaurants-tend-to-be-quite-expensive>Gordon Ramsay's Restaurants Tend To Be Quite Expensive</h2><p>So, how much does it cost to dine at Gordon Ramsay's restaurants? Well., if you want the good stuff, you'd better be prepared to fork over some dough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Culinary Travellers</a>, "The prices will be different of course. But we need to take the cost as an average. For example, a burger will cost you around $20. If we are talking about a proper meal with 7 courses the price will be way above $100 per person. A la Carte Menu for 2 at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay Michelin Star will cost you 260 Euros for a couple. That is a cheap meal compared to the other meals that are available," the site writes.</p><p>However, things get more expensive from there, should you be willing to pay a premium.</p><p>"There is an option you could go called ‘Restaurant Gordon Ramsay Masterclass Experience’ which is far too costly than what I just said. This will cost you around $1200 for you and your partner. A Michelin Star Experience at Gordon Ramsay Restaurants will cost you somewhere between $150 to $1200. This does not include any tips," the site continues.</p><p>Now, on the lower end of things, just over $100 is not too bad, all things considered. Plenty of upscale spots charge more than this. On the higher end, however, is where things get ludicrous. Then again, if the bill is that much, then the food is likely divine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything To Know About Gordon Ramsay's New Co-Star, Nyesha Arrington</a></span></p><p>If you're looking to get some gourmet Gordon grub, then start saving now, especially if you're looking for the best experience available.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Did Gordon Ramsay Get Sued For 'Kitchen Nightmares'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOhnGaZppq%2ForPEZpqoq6RivKd5xJqroqaXYq61ec6nnGanlmK0sL7DqKVmqpGiwKLF0mapnqukqr%2BiutOsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-average-cost-of-eating-at-one-of-gordon-ramsays-resturants.html&text=What%20Is%20The%20Average%20Cost%20Of%20Eating%20At%20One%20Of%20Gordon%20Ramsay%27s%20Restaurants%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-average-cost-of-eating-at-one-of-gordon-ramsays-resturants.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-average-cost-of-eating-at-one-of-gordon-ramsays-resturants.html&title=What%20Is%20The%20Average%20Cost%20Of%20Eating%20At%20One%20Of%20Gordon%20Ramsay%27s%20Restaurants%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-the-average-cost-of-eating-at-one-of-gordon-ramsays-resturants.html&title=What%20Is%20The%20Average%20Cost%20Of%20Eating%20At%20One%20Of%20Gordon%20Ramsay%27s%20Restaurants%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-average-cost-of-eating-at-one-of-gordon-ramsays-resturants.html&title=What%20Is%20The%20Average%20Cost%20Of%20Eating%20At%20One%20Of%20Gordon%20Ramsay%27s%20Restaurants%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-average-cost-of-eating-at-one-of-gordon-ramsays-resturants.html&description=What%20Is%20The%20Average%20Cost%20Of%20Eating%20At%20One%20Of%20Gordon%20Ramsay%27s%20Restaurants%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jonna-walshs-husband-bio-age-net-worth-2022-height-movies-tassco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jonna Walshs Husband?
