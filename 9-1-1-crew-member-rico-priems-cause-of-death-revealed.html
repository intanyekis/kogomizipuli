His death was also confirmed by IATSE.</p><p>The organization released a statement in light of the tragedy.</p><p>“We are fully committed to the safety and the well-being of all our members and express our heartfelt condolences to the member’s family,” the statement read. “Workers have a reasonable expectation that they can get to work and come home safely. No one should be put in unsafe circumstances while trying to earn a living.”</p><p>Priem’s former colleagues, including <strong>Angela Bassett</strong>, continue to mourn him.</p><p>“The studio, 9-1-1, we all extend our deepest condolences to his friends to his family,” Bassett, 65, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> in <a href=# rel=noopener>an interview</a> published on May 14. “It was just a very, very sad moment. We’re all rocked by it, certainly.”</p><p>Bassett, who portrays Los Angeles Police Department patrol sergeant, Athena Grant-Nash, on the show, noted that during her time on the series, the cast and crew have experienced “births” and “weddings” together, but this is their first time dealing with loss.</p><p>The actress added that time was taken on set at 9-1-1, which has <a href=# rel=noopener>just wrapped</a> its seventh season, to honor Priem and “so many beautiful words were spoken of him.”</p><p>Priem’s fellow crew member, <strong>Nina Moskol</strong>, who also works as a grip on 9-1-1, also paid tribute to her friend.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He was on the cusp of retirement, with his paperwork filed. He had his already rich life planned for retirement, including spending time with his wife, watching his grand-nephew grow, riding his beloved Harley, and even gripping still to stay connected to his friends,” Moskol wrote on May 12, per the Crew Stories Instagram account. “He was so jazzed about what he had learned about retiring, he wanted to teach the ins and outs of retirement at the local.”</p><p>Union members have long been outspoken about the length of production shifts, going on strike in 2021.</p><p>The union ultimately won a 54-hour weekend rest period, with the goal of curbing late Friday shifts that extend until Saturday morning. The union’s current contract is up on July 31.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyZWFifm6v0Z6uZqWVoq%2BmvoyroJynXaW%2FqrHMrGScmaWosm67xWabnpmknXqzsdWemKWdlGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f9-1-1-crew-member-rico-priems-cause-of-death-revealed.html&text=9-1-1%20Crew%20Member%20Rico%20Priems%20Cause%20of%20Death%20Revealed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f9-1-1-crew-member-rico-priems-cause-of-death-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f9-1-1-crew-member-rico-priems-cause-of-death-revealed.html&title=9-1-1%20Crew%20Member%20Rico%20Priems%20Cause%20of%20Death%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f9-1-1-crew-member-rico-priems-cause-of-death-revealed.html&title=9-1-1%20Crew%20Member%20Rico%20Priems%20Cause%20of%20Death%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f9-1-1-crew-member-rico-priems-cause-of-death-revealed.html&title=9-1-1%20Crew%20Member%20Rico%20Priems%20Cause%20of%20Death%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f9-1-1-crew-member-rico-priems-cause-of-death-revealed.html&description=9-1-1%20Crew%20Member%20Rico%20Priems%20Cause%20of%20Death%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dare-taylor-disney-princess-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-96416-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dare Taylor  Disney Princess Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationalit">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-pat-sajak-black-wife-and-daughter-details-of-pat-sajak-wife-lesly-brown-and-sherrill-sajak-and-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Pat Sajak Black Wife and Daughter?
