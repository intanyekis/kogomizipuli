I didn’t know whether any of us was offside or not.</p><p>“It doesn’t have any influence because there was no one close to him, so it doesn’t make any influence on the (City) team-mates to defend. The only one (defender) close was one close to me. It is what it is. It’s a goal, at the end, and we are really happy for that.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>City manager Pep Guardiola said: “Rashford is offside, Bruno is not offside, the question is interference. When one player from 18-yard box shooters and one player is in front of the keeper but doesn’t touch the ball, it is disallowed all the time.</p><p>“The situation and the decision is the referee’s, the VAR, our defenders make a line (for Rashford), if we know it’s Fernandes we don’t make the line, we follow the action, and after the action the interference for Edi (Ederson).</p><p>“This is the decision in this stadium with the referee and the VAR. After conceding a goal we cannot concede the next one, this is the most important detail we have to improve in the future.</p><p>“Are we going to make a complaint? No. It sometimes happens on our side.</p><p>“The decision is they didn’t believe Rashford was intervening in this stadium. This is Old Trafford, we have to play much better, like Anfield, we have to do better.”</p><h2>What did the goal mean?</h2><p>It was crucial in the context of the game.</p><p>City had been the better team since half-time and were 1-0 ahead courtesy of a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jack Grealish</a> goal.</p><p>Fernandes’ equaliser was swiftly followed by a goal from Rashford to put Erik ten Hag’s team ahead.</p><p>It put United on the way to a win that puts them into third just a single point behind City.</p><p>The win also moves them straight into the title picture — remarkably, given their bad start to the season — as they would be just six points behind current leaders <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Arsenal</a>. Arsenal, though, will have a game in hand.</p><h2><b data-stringify-type=bold>How did the managers react to the goal?</b></h2><p>Erik ten Hag clearly was surprised it had been allowed.</p><p>He admitted: “I wouldn’t be happy if my team conceded a goal like this. You saw the reaction from the other team.”</p><p>He also told BT Sport: “I can see it from the other side as well. The rules, it’s a confusing moment for the back line of the opponent. The rules say Marcus didn’t touch the ball and he wasn’t interfering. Bruno came from the back — but I can see it from the other side.”</p><p>(Photo: Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2lwaWxobXxzfJFsZmlpX2aBcK7RrqWoZZaav6%2BtzZ2crGWXpK6tec6fnayhlJp6rq3NnJ%2Beq6Sav27BzaKrnpxdmLa1xY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbruno-fernandes-goal-offside-manchester-united-city.html&text=Why%20was%20Bruno%20Fernandes%20goal%20allowed%20to%20stand%20against%20Manchester%20City%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbruno-fernandes-goal-offside-manchester-united-city.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbruno-fernandes-goal-offside-manchester-united-city.html&title=Why%20was%20Bruno%20Fernandes%20goal%20allowed%20to%20stand%20against%20Manchester%20City%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbruno-fernandes-goal-offside-manchester-united-city.html&title=Why%20was%20Bruno%20Fernandes%20goal%20allowed%20to%20stand%20against%20Manchester%20City%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbruno-fernandes-goal-offside-manchester-united-city.html&title=Why%20was%20Bruno%20Fernandes%20goal%20allowed%20to%20stand%20against%20Manchester%20City%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbruno-fernandes-goal-offside-manchester-united-city.html&description=Why%20was%20Bruno%20Fernandes%20goal%20allowed%20to%20stand%20against%20Manchester%20City%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brendan-fraser-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'The Whale' Gave It a Bump">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-palins-daughter-willow-welcomes-3rd-baby-with-ricky-bailey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Palins Daughter Willow Welcomes 3rd Baby With Ricky Bailey">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
