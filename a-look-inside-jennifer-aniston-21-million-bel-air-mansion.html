Aniston has since decorated the mansion to her own tastes. Aniston loves to roam around the 8,500-square-foot property where she’d rather stay than go out. At the time, Aniston was planning to relocate to Los Angeles from Manhattan and when she has bought the mansion, it was just finished after some renovation made by architect Frederick Fisher. The Bel-Air mansion gives a bit too cool yet minimal vibe which embraces the vision of Jones, these features is something Aniston wants to redesign as she wants something different. Aniston has sought the help of the interior designer Stephen Shadley to transform the mansion and give it a warm and zen space for her to enjoy a peaceful time at the place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mansion has a lot of wood, bronze and stone materials which have depth and real substance which gives off some natural vibe. According to Shadley, Aniston specifically asked them to transform the place to be more inviting and warm which is what they did. <a href=#>The décor of the rooms</a> in the mansion has the Midcentury furniture combined with sophisticated black-and-white color and fine art scheme. Among the rooms in the mansion is a room with a bar with a cozy lounge area. The entire vibe of the place radiates positivity which is swathed in neutral tones. Aniston credits the beauty of her home to the team effort of Shadley with Los Angeles based designers Jane Hallworth and Kathleen and Tommy Clements.</p><h2 id=features-of-the-mansion>Features of The Mansion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston has an extremely beautiful home office at the mansion and she said that she feels powerful every she sits at her desk. The executive suite has some international conglomerate vibe which <a href=#>radiates authority and power</a>. The kitchen of the property is light filled which Aniston thinks that makes it much cozier and she loves it that way.
