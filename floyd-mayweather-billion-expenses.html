His iconic fights&nbsp;have drawn millions of fans to each and every event, and when he entered the ring, everyone knew he meant business. The world has watched in awe as he shattered record after record throughout his career. Known as one of the best, if not the best, defensive boxer in history, Floyd Mayweather's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> current net worth sits at a whopping $450 million</a>, but that's not the most shocking news we have for you. The truth of the matter is he could easily be worth well over $1 billion. In act, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> reports that he has earned well over $1 billion in fight prize money alone. He'd be worth more, except for the fact that his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">excessive spending habits</a> seem to get in the way of that level of monetary accumulation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So what does this multi-millionaire athlete do with all his cash? We've discovered that this superstar has some pretty expensive habits...</p><h2 id=massive-mansions>Massive Mansions</h2><p>Floyd Mayweather weighs in at 147 pounds and stands five feet and 8 inches tall. His body mass is pure muscle, and this big guy needs a big home. Not just any home will do, though. Floyd Mayweather isn't shy about enjoying the fruits of his labor. When it comes to his humble abode, he didn't hesitate to drop $25 million dollars. Outfitted with all the luxuries you'd expect from a home of this caliber, this mansion boasts the very best that luxury living has to offer, as well as a few unique perks. Mayweather's mansion has it's own candy shop and a 12 seat theatre, making this sound like a very fun place to pass his time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather Gives 5-Week-Old Grandson A $45,000 Gift</a></span></p><h2 id=private-jets>Private Jets</h2><p>Mayweather has risen to the very top of his game, and when it's time to travel, commercial airlines simply won't do. Opting to travel on his "Air Mayweather Private Jet", <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Insider</a> reports that this legendary boxer truly enjoys<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> luxury travel to the fullest extent.</a> The cup holders in the jet are made of gold, and the finest leather was used in this very spacious jet plane. So how much did Mayweather spend on his Gulfstream G650? The answer may shock you. He dropped an astounding $60 million on this one plane, and for those who are unaware... he owns 2.</p><h2 id=security-guards>Security Guards</h2><p>Mayweather is too famous to go anywhere without being recognized, and history indicates he has a habit of finding trouble when he is out and about. As a way of taking preventative measures, Floyd Mayweather finds it fitting to hire security guards to travel alongside him and keep things on the up and up, especially when crazed fans are near. Being a professional boxer means regular security guards won't do. He's hired the biggest, and the best there is, and spends over $150,000 a year to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> keep them on payroll.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cars>Cars</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flashy Floyd loves to travel in style</a> on the road as much as he does in the air. He drops money without hesitation when it comes to his car collection. In fact, he dropped $6.5 million on two Bugatti sports cars, and owns a rare supercar that is worth $4.7 on its own. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a> indicates that his rare Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita is one of two that exist in the world, and it travels at an impressive 409 kph.</p><h2 id=watches>Watches</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayweather absolutely loves watches, and of course, he has a huge collection of luxury watches at his disposal. The most notable of them all is an $18 million watch called "The Billionaire," that was designed by Jacob & Co. It boasts 280 carats and there's only one of these in the world. It was apparently too rare and valuable for Mayweather to pass up and now proudly sits amid his collection.</p><h2 id=legal-woes>Legal Woes</h2><p>Mayweather is no stranger to reckless behavior and has been arrested on more than one occasion. He has displayed both control and anger issues, and has been arrested for domestic violence, and did jail time for 'battery domestic violence.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His legal team has taken a good chunk of Mayweather's change, and reports indicate he has spent millions to get himself out of trouble. That's in addition to the $26 million he paid to the IRS for issues with his taxes.</p><h2 id=meals>Meals</h2><p>Keeping at the top of his physical form means Floyd Mayweather has some particular dietary requirements and he engages the assistance of a personal chef to make sure all his needs are met. He has employed Quiana Jeffries to take care of all meals that are prepared for him, and he keeps her on call 24 hours a day. It seems to pay off for Quiana quite nicely though, as she is paid $1,000 for each meal she creates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shopping-sprees>Shopping&nbsp; Sprees</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The luxury lifestyle of Floyd Mayweather </a>spans into his shopping spree experiences as well. He's all about the 'bling' and is flashy with his outward appearance, all of which comes with a hefty price tag. In 2018 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ broke the story</a> of his $5.3 million jewelry shopping spree at Peter Marco in Beverly Hills. All the items purchased were for him, and none of them seem linked to any special occasions - this was just a random shopping experience, on a whim.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Expensive Sports Cars Only Floyd Mayweather Can Afford</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzrbvYnWSmmamssqLAx56pZpqZobmqu81mnLGolaPApr%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-billion-expenses.html&text=8%20Ways%20Boxing%20Champion%20Floyd%20Mayweather%20Spent%20His%20Half%20A%20Billion&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffloyd-mayweather-billion-expenses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-billion-expenses.html&title=8%20Ways%20Boxing%20Champion%20Floyd%20Mayweather%20Spent%20His%20Half%20A%20Billion" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-billion-expenses.html&title=8%20Ways%20Boxing%20Champion%20Floyd%20Mayweather%20Spent%20His%20Half%20A%20Billion" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-billion-expenses.html&title=8%20Ways%20Boxing%20Champion%20Floyd%20Mayweather%20Spent%20His%20Half%20A%20Billion" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-billion-expenses.html&description=8%20Ways%20Boxing%20Champion%20Floyd%20Mayweather%20Spent%20His%20Half%20A%20Billion" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gibi-asmr.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gibi ASMR">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./2021-who-is-robyn-lively-blake-livelys-sister-heres-everything-you-should-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Robyn Lively  Blake Livelys Sister?
