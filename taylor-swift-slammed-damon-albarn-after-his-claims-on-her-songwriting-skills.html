Her growth as a musician and person has been remarkable since her debut in 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But with an extensive career comes significant criticism.</p><p>Taylor has been facing false accusations and claims over her talent for a long time now. Recently, it was Blur front-man and Gorillaz co-creator Damon Albarn who had some thoughts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Just Some Amazing Things Taylor Swift Has Done For The World</a></span></p><p>Of course, Taylor didn't take Damon's criticism lightly, and she had some thoughts to share on the issue.</p><h2 id=what-did-damon-say-about-taylor-swift><strong>What Did Damon Say About Taylor Swift?</strong></h2><p>In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Blur frontman claimed Taylor doesn't write her own songs</a>. After the interviewer pointed out that she, in fact, does write her songs and often times with a co-writer, Albarn dismissed it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He proceeded to say, "That doesn't count. I know what co-writing is. Co-writing is very different to writing. I'm not hating on anybody. I'm just saying there's a big difference between a songwriter and a songwriter who co-writes. Doesn't mean that the outcome can't be really great."</p><p>Albarn then praised singer Billie Eilish and said, "A really interesting songwriter is Billie Eilish and her brother [Finneas O'Connell]. I'm more attracted to that than to Taylor Swift. It's just darker — less endlessly upbeat. Way more minor and odd. I think she's exceptional."</p><h2 id=taylor-and-other-artists-reaction><strong>Taylor And Other Artists' Reaction</strong></h2><p>The August singer took to Twitter to clap back at Albarn. She quoted the tweet of the Los Angeles Times and wrote an honest and scathing retort for all to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added a follow-up tweet and wrote, "PS I wrote this tweet all by myself in case you were wondering."</p><p>Swift was clearly very angry at Albarn's claims over her songwriting skills while she has been writing her songs herself from the very beginning.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What Taylor Swift Has Been Doing Since Announcing Her 'Red' Re-Recording</a></span></p><p>Jack Antonoff, who has worked on many tracks with Taylor, also spoke about this insensitive comment on his Twitter.</p><p>The Bleachers front-man said in a tweet, "I've never met Damon Albarn, and he's never been to my studio, but apparently he knows more than the rest of us about all those songs Taylor writes and brings in."</p><p>In another follow-up tweet, he wrote, "If you were there, cool go off. If not, maybe shut the f**k up?" Singer Maren Morris also supported Taylor and tweeted, "Writing songs with songwriters means you're a songwriter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was pretty clear Albarn's comment on Swift's songwriting skills was not just a take on her, but everyone else who writes their own songs with a songwriter.</p><h2 id=albarn-s-unconditional-apology><strong>Albarn's 'Unconditional' Apology</strong></h2><p>After Taylor's massive reply to his claims, Damon apologized to her by replying to her tweet.</p><p>He wrote, "I totally agree with you. I had a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait. I apologize unreservedly and unconditionally. The last thing I would want to do is discredit your songwriting. I hope you understand."</p><p>Unfortunately, the fans did not buy his 'apology' and slammed him for trying to turn the cards.</p><p>Swift, for her part, has not spoken about this any further.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-not-the-first-time-for-taylor><strong>This Is Not The First Time For Taylor</strong></h2><p>This is not the first time someone has discredited or falsely accused Taylor Swift. In 2009, <a href=#>Kanye West interrupted her AMA speech</a> claiming Beyonce deserved the award for theBest Female Video.</p><p>Then he continued to shame Swift through interviews, songs, and apparently fake videos. Taylor fired back every time with a speech, an Instagram post, or the Look What You Made Me Do music video.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Did Taylor Swift Say After Being Interrupted By Kanye West?</a></span></p><p>Swift has also always been an easy target for sexist people. Her <a href=#>songs are often about her long list of ex-boyfriends</a>, for which she is shamed. At the same time, the men in the industry sing about their ex-lovers and gain praises.</p><p>In 2020, the Red singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told fans that 100% of her old music was sold without her knowledge</a>. This forced her to re-record all of her previous albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift has so far released Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's version) and will be re-releasing her debut album Taylor Swift plus Speak Now and 1989.</p><p>The constant shaming and shading, undermining her talent, saying she is undeserving did not shake her.</p><p>It only made Taylor Swift stronger and one of the biggest stars in the music industry, as she said in her hit single Shake It Off, "Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake. Shake it off, shake it off."</p><h2 id=what-s-next-for-taylor><strong>What's Next For Taylor</strong></h2><p>Recently, <a href=#>Taylor's All Too Well (10-minute version) broke a record</a> as it became the longest song to reach number one on Billboard Top 100. Hopefully, the fans will soon receive another Taylor version of Swift's old albums and the Easter eggs that come with it.</p><p>Regardless, we hope she releases new music soon!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Impressive Guinness World Records</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lo6GurrnEnWSdmZ2ku26ty5uYq6ZdlrO1sdFmn6KrXZi5orXMrGSopl2dsrN50qiloK%2BinsGqusZmqqShnKHAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-slammed-damon-albarn-after-his-claims-on-her-songwriting-skills.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20Slammed%20Damon%20Albarn%20Following%20His%20Claims%20About%20Her%20Songwriting%20Skills&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-slammed-damon-albarn-after-his-claims-on-her-songwriting-skills.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-slammed-damon-albarn-after-his-claims-on-her-songwriting-skills.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Slammed%20Damon%20Albarn%20Following%20His%20Claims%20About%20Her%20Songwriting%20Skills" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-slammed-damon-albarn-after-his-claims-on-her-songwriting-skills.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Slammed%20Damon%20Albarn%20Following%20His%20Claims%20About%20Her%20Songwriting%20Skills" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-slammed-damon-albarn-after-his-claims-on-her-songwriting-skills.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Slammed%20Damon%20Albarn%20Following%20His%20Claims%20About%20Her%20Songwriting%20Skills" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-slammed-damon-albarn-after-his-claims-on-her-songwriting-skills.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20Slammed%20Damon%20Albarn%20Following%20His%20Claims%20About%20Her%20Songwriting%20Skills" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-challenges-jordan-wiseley-dating-someone-new-after-tori-deal-split.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Challenge's Jordan Wiseley Dating Someone New After Tori Deal Split">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./texas-tech-recruiting-history-best-worst-signings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Landing Pat Mahomes, developing Wes Welker and more: Texas Tech Recruiting Rewind">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
