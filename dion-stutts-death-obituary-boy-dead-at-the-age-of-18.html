He expressed the same level of enthusiasm about participating in the program that we did about having him on board.</p><p>Stutts, a three-star prospect in football and a top wrestler in the Memphis region committed to play for Arkansas in March after a stellar high school career at MUS.</p><p>Dion Stutts, a Defensive Lineman at Memphis University School (MUS), has become a local celebrity in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was Dion Stutts?</h2><p>Stutts attracted interest from several top-tier college football programmes thanks to his impressive abilities and work ethic, but he ultimately decided to play for the University of Arkansas in 2024.</p><p>A tragic ATV accident on his family’s farm in the Batesville area of Mississippi cut short the life of the talented young athlete.&nbsp;</p><p>MUS head coach Bobby Alston broke the tragic news to the Memphis Commercial Appeal, saying that he believed Stutts had died in the collision.</p><p>During his tenure at MUS, Stutts, a great talent, dominated many sports. He was rated as a strong four-star wrestler and a three-star football recruit.&nbsp;</p><p>The highly sought-after defensive lineman’s commitment to the University of Arkansas was publicised on Twitter three months earlier, and nobody was surprised.</p><p>Stutts, who was six feet three inches tall and weighed 250 pounds. He was regarded as the 82nd-best player at his position in the 2024 class because of his exceptional athletic abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Many prestigious universities saw his potential and extended offers. Including Texas A&M, Ole Miss, South Carolina, Louisville, and Tulane.</p><p>Stutts’s family owned and operated a cattle farm west of Oxford. But he never allowed it to get in the way of his dedication to school and sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Since seventh grade, he had made the daily trip from his family’s farm to Memphis University School. Which took him more than an hour each way.</p><p>Dion Stutts has shown tremendous skill, commitment, and perseverance in his work. His life was cut short, but his legacy as a brilliant athlete and unyielding pursuit of his goals will live on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Dion Stutts?</h2><p>Multi-sport star and Arkansas football commit Dion Stutts passed away on Tuesday night, according to Memphis University School football coach and athletic director Bobby Alston, who spoke with The Commercial Appeal. He was 18.</p><p>Alston said Stutts was killed on his property in the Batesville, Mississippi, region while riding an all-terrain vehicle. He had recently graduated as a junior from MUS.</p><p>When a reporter from The Commercial Appeal inquired with the Batesville Police Department about Stutts’s accident, they were forwarded to the Panola County Sheriff’s Office.&nbsp;</p><p>The Panola County Sheriff’s Office declined to respond and asked that the reporter try again on Wednesday during <a href=#>business</a> hours.</p><p>Our deepest sympathies go out to the family. Dion was an outstanding young man. “When you spent time with him, his smile would warm your whole body,” Alston added.</p><p>After accumulating 30 and 13 tackles for loss as a junior last autumn. Stutts was one of the best defensive linemen in the Memphis area to return for the 2023 season.&nbsp;</p><p>Stutts, a three-star prospect, pledged his allegiance to Arkansas in March. Stutts excelled as a wrestler at MUS as well.</p><p>“And all we can do right now is pray for him and his family.” Alston continued. “We’re going to miss that grin, miss that amazing demeanour.” we all said at the same time.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwyKilZqukqsG1v4ydnJqsmGK8o7XTrpirsV2XvLp5w56YnWWRqXq1tMRmmKCdXaSzbn2XaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdion-stutts-death-obituary-boy-dead-at-the-age-of-18.html&text=Dion%20Stutts%20Death%20And%20Obituary%3a%20Boy%20Dead%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2018&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdion-stutts-death-obituary-boy-dead-at-the-age-of-18.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdion-stutts-death-obituary-boy-dead-at-the-age-of-18.html&title=Dion%20Stutts%20Death%20And%20Obituary%3a%20Boy%20Dead%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2018" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdion-stutts-death-obituary-boy-dead-at-the-age-of-18.html&title=Dion%20Stutts%20Death%20And%20Obituary%3a%20Boy%20Dead%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2018" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdion-stutts-death-obituary-boy-dead-at-the-age-of-18.html&title=Dion%20Stutts%20Death%20And%20Obituary%3a%20Boy%20Dead%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2018" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdion-stutts-death-obituary-boy-dead-at-the-age-of-18.html&description=Dion%20Stutts%20Death%20And%20Obituary%3a%20Boy%20Dead%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2018" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-lifetimes-house-of-chains-based-on-a-true-story-where-was-it-filmed-who-is-in-the-cast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Lifetimes House of Chains Based on a True Story?
