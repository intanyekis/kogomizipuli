Novak Djokovic has been ranked number one for 332 straight weeks and has won the year-end tournaments six times. His life revolves mostly around sports, but in his spare time, he enjoys riding around on some amazing cars. Here is Novak Djokovic's luxurious car collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=peugeot-e-208-x-novak-djokovic>Peugeot e-208 x Novak Djokovic</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Novak Djokovic, a tennis star from Serbia, is not only an extremely proud owner of Peugeot, but he is also an extremely proud marketing advocate for Peugeot. Because he won the Australian 2020 competition, <a href=#>the legendary tennis player</a> was presented with a gift and a prize in the form of his very own limited edition e-208 from the company. It is a totally electric vehicle, the tennis player's childhood fantasy. They unveiled the vehicle following his victory and seek to excite electric-car enthusiasts by designing a vehicle with features that are contrary to the norm. Its 50 kWh lithium-ion battery and single-speed transmission are suitable for a driver who wants only comfort and ease.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=peugeot-rcz>Peugeot RCZ</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Peugeot RCZ is a concept-style sports coupe available in three fashionable trim levels. In Novak's collection is the Red Carbon trim, which offers the same features as the GT with the addition of clever modifications. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Red Carbon Peugeot RCZ</a>, unlike the GT model, features an enhanced navigation system, metallic paintwork, and a striking red dashboard. The Red Carbon engine complements the GT. Both are 1.6-liter gasoline engines with 197 horsepower. The suspension is modified to deliver sharper turning and handling to match the increased power. Although the RCZ is a modest sports car, it is, to say the least, exciting and youthful, much like Novak's personality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Cars In Vince McMahon's Massive Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=bentley-continental-gt>Bentley Continental GT</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Bentley Continental GT is one of the most spectacular luxury vehicles in Novak's portfolio. This Bentley model is among their most popular. The Continental GT's both look and perform well. In about 3.6 seconds, the 4-liter V8 engine propels the vehicle from 0 to 60 miles per hour. For a grand tourer that is generally driven leisurely, it is brisk and perfect for <a href=#>celebrities who enjoy driving in luxury</a>. With a price tag of approximately $200,000, the automobile is one of Novak's priciest assets.</p><h2 id=mercedes-benz-s500>Mercedes Benz S500</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class was introduced in 1996 as a full-size sedan. It was a 4-door sedan at the time. Style-wise and performance-wise, the S-Class is now a genuine sedan. Clearly, Novak enjoys a classy and slow ride. The S-Class is quite popular among celebrities due to its comfort and luxurious appearance. The S-Class is equipped with a 3-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine and a 9-speed automated transmission by Mercedes-Benz. This makes it an all-wheel drive. Novak's ownership of an S-Class is unsurprising, given the vehicle's strength and complexity.</p><h2 id=aston-martin-db9-volante>Aston Martin DB9 Volante</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Aston Martin DB9 Volante was unveiled for the first time in 2003, prompting widespread attention. Fortunately, Novak has one in his lineup. The luxury tourer is available as both a coupe and a convertible, with Novak's vehicle being the latter. Being one of <a href=#>the richest tennis players</a>, you would assume he would choose the more expensive option, wouldn't you? Aston Martin has equipped their more recent DB9 Volantes with a 5.9-liter AM11 V12 engine, which received a facelift in response to drivers' need for an enhanced driving experience. The modifications were well worth it because the newer DB9 Volante can now reach 186 miles per hour.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Talk Show Royalty Garage: Inside Ellen DeGeneres' Massive Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=audi-r8>Audi R8</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Novak appears to have a passion for fast cars. The Audi R8 is the quickest vehicle in his collection, with a maximum speed of 205.1 miles per hour. The Audi two-seater supercar's V10 engine provides both speed and comfort. Surprisingly, a number of drivers claim that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Audi R8 is great</a> if you're looking for both speed and comfort. Recent enhancements have resulted in a more aerodynamic driving experience, which is perfect for city driving and acceleration.</p><h2 id=tesla-model-x>Tesla Model X</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Tesla Model X is another luxury car in Djokovic's collection. The Tesla Model X is an electric SUV that was released for the first time in 2015. Model X prices range from around $114,990 to $138,990 based on the selected options and upgrades. Djokovic's Tesla Model X is the performance-oriented P90D variant of the SUV. The P90D has a range of around 270 miles and can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in under 3.8 seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bentley-gt-coupe>Bentley GT Coupe</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bentley GT Coupe is one of Djokovic's <a href=#>most exceptional car collections</a>. The GT Coupe is a premium grand tourer that was introduced for the first time in 2003. It is propelled by a 6.0L W12 engine and is capable of 200 miles per hour. As with the other vehicles on this list, the GT Coupe's price ranges from approximately $202,500 to £315,000 based on customizations and upgrades.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>From College Dropout To A Billionaire: Here's How Alexandr Wang Became The Youngest Billionaire In The World<span style=font-weight:400></span></a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmoola</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Post</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmp56dm2K2r7%2FInZxmrJWju6q%2FjKysqZ2iqMGivoynpq%2BZm2Kxq7vKqK2im6NiubbE1KugqK2jYrCivoycpqWklZjBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-inside-tennis-superstar-novak-djokovics-luxurious-car-collection.html&text=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Tennis%20Superstar%20Novak%20Djokovic%27s%20Luxurious%20Car%20Collection&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-inside-tennis-superstar-novak-djokovics-luxurious-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-tennis-superstar-novak-djokovics-luxurious-car-collection.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Tennis%20Superstar%20Novak%20Djokovic%27s%20Luxurious%20Car%20Collection" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-peek-inside-tennis-superstar-novak-djokovics-luxurious-car-collection.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Tennis%20Superstar%20Novak%20Djokovic%27s%20Luxurious%20Car%20Collection" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-tennis-superstar-novak-djokovics-luxurious-car-collection.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Tennis%20Superstar%20Novak%20Djokovic%27s%20Luxurious%20Car%20Collection" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-inside-tennis-superstar-novak-djokovics-luxurious-car-collection.html&description=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Tennis%20Superstar%20Novak%20Djokovic%27s%20Luxurious%20Car%20Collection" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erik-haula-alex-tuch-minnesota-wild-vegas-golden-knights-expansion-draft-trade-anatomy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anatomy of the trade that sent Erik Haula and Alex Tuch from the Wild to Vegas">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./madchen-amick-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-376863-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mdchen Amick Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
