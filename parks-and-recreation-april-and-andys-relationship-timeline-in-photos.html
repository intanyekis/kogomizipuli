We are living in a time where we've been able to watch couples like Michael Scott and Holly Flax, Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd and of course, April Ludgate and Andy Dwyer flourish right before our very eyes. Now, while all of these romances have been spectacular, there is something extra special about Parks and Recreations' April and Andy. Two people who are&nbsp;unlike anyone else, coming together to make one unstoppable duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, we will be remembering just how far Andy and April have traveled as a couple. From their rocky beginning in season 2, to their purchase of their very first haunted house. We have got every magical (and creepy) moment right here!</p><h2 id=season-1-andy-was-a-totally-different-person><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Season 1 Andy Was A Totally Different Person</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1-Andy-Edited.jpg><p>Andy Dwyer is without a doubt the character who evolved the most throughout the 7 seasons. Looking back at him in season one, with his two broken legs of course,&nbsp;he seems like a different person. A terrible boyfriend to Ann and ultimately unhappy, he really needed April in his life to become the person he was always meant to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=let-s-get-real-season-1-april-was-just-as-adorable-as-season-7-april><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Let's Get Real, Season 1 April Was Just As Adorable As Season 7 April</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2-April-Edited.jpg><p>Even though April also evolved throughout the series, her transition was not as drastic as Andy's. Even back in the early days of season 1, April was cynical, moody, hilarious and obviously, rocking the best t-shirt/hoodie combos of anyone working in government. Let's not forget that she also fell for Andy first.</p><h2 id=andy-s-declaration-of-like><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Andy's Declaration Of Like</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-Parks-And-Rec-Edited.png><p>This is the episode in which we finally saw Andy realise he liked April and confess his feelings to her. While she was happy to hear the feelings were mutual and even high-fived him for it, she ultimately turned him down in fears that he still had a lingering thing for Ann Perkins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-hospital-kiss><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The Hospital Kiss</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4-Parks-and-Rec-Edited.jpg><p>This should have marked the start of their amazing romance, but unfortunately, Andy also kissed Ann in this episode. Once April found out about the kiss, she was gone. Determined to get over Andy, she tried dating Eduardo briefly, though everyone (especially Ron) knew she wouldn't be able to resist Andy forever.</p><h2 id=burt-macklin-amp-janet-snakehole><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Burt Macklin & Janet Snakehole</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-April-and-Andy-Edited.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After settling all of their issues, Andy and April finally started their relationship. At the beginning of their romance, we got some pretty spectacular episodes. One of the best being of course, the first appearance of Burt Macklin and Janet Snakehole. What started out as a&nbsp;simple&nbsp;role playing game, turned into two of TV's best alter egos ever.</p><h2 id=the-wedding><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Wedding</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-Apirl-and-Andy-Wedding-Edited.png><p>April and Andy knew they were meant to be very early on in their relationship. They decided to surprise all of their friends and family with an impromptu wedding during a 'fancy' party they had thrown. Even though Leslie and the rest of the gang&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;on board, there was no way anyone could stop these two crazy kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=know-ya-boo><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Know Ya Boo!</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/7-Andy-April-Edited.png><p>Tom's game show, Know Ya Boo!, was the first real test of Andy and April's relationship as a married couple. Obviously, they failed it miserably and wound up in one of their bigger fights. However, knowing they needed to make things right, April went to her sworn enemy, Ann Perkins, for advice on how to&nbsp;fix the situation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little-Known Facts About Chris Pratt's Time On Parks And Recreation</a></span></p><h2 id=it-wasn-t-mount-rushmore-but-their-trip-to-the-grand-canyon-was-beautiful><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>It Wasn't Mount Rushmore, But Their Trip To The Grand Canyon Was Beautiful</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/8-April-and-Andy-Edited.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being the amazing wife she is, April was determined to help Andy complete his bucket list. After checking off almost everything, Andy revealed that he had always wanted to see the Grand Canyon. They road-tripped it there and had a truly heartwarming moment, which was only somewhat ruined by Andy&nbsp;asking "Where's all the faces?"</p><h2 id=the-king-and-queen-of-halloween><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The King And Queen Of Halloween</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/9-Parks-and-rec-Edited.jpg><p>April and Andy are obviously great at putting together characters and costumes. So, whenever a Halloween episode came around, they really shined. That being said, we can't forget that poor Ben lived with them for a handful of years. Clearly, he had to put up with a lot as their roommate...</p><h2 id=the-loneliest-ladies-in-dc><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Loneliest Ladies In DC</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-Parcs-and-Rec-Edited.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When April and Leslie headed out to work in DC, it meant a long-distance strain on both of their relationships. April and Andy did handle it like champs, but watching them live apart wasn't all that fun. At least April and Leslie had each other and of course, the care packages Ben and Andy would send.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things You Didn't Know About Aubrey Plaza's Time On Parks And Recreation</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-karate-is-the-man><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Johnny Karate Is The Man</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/11-Johnny-Karate-Edited.jpg><p>Andy wasn't too bored while April was away in DC. He was still attempting to pass his police officer course and he also started to create the awesome character of Johnny Karate. Of course, his TV show would not come until years later, but it was nice to see Andy coping with not only being alone, but failing his police exam and ultimately losing his band Mouse Rat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-unity-concert-was-magical><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Unity Concert Was Magical</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12-Andy-and-April-Edited.jpg><p>Honestly, the series could have wrapped up with the Unity Concert and everyone would have been totally fine with it. The entire event was a massive success, but April arranging for Andy to close out the show with his former band was priceless. Andy's performance of 5000 Candles in the Wind with Ginuwine on backup vocals and Duke Silver on the Sax, brought a tear to everyone's eye.</p><h2 id=april-and-andy-move-into-a-grown-up-house><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>April And Andy Move Into A Grown Up House</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/13-April-and-Andy-house-Edited.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Andy's career as Johnny Karate kicked off, the couple had more money then they had ever had before.
