Despite going their separate ways almost a year ago, <a href=#>their friendship may have just taken a sour turn</a>. According to a fan of the band, Jesy blocked her former Little Mix members on social media. Allegedly, he got a DM from Leigh-Anne telling him that Jesy cut them off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were quick to notice that all three current members of <a href=#>Little Mix stopped following Jesy on Instagram</a>, leading them to believe that there's some drama going down. However, after finding out that, in reality, Jesy blocked all the girls of Little Mix on her Instagram account, fans got absolutely furious with her. On top of that, Jesy Nelson's recent controversies, including Jesy's attempt to appear black, only make matters worse.</p><h2 id=blackfishing-accusations>Blackfishing Accusations</h2><p>Leigh-Anne liked an Instagram post by British TV personality Zeze Millz where she called out Jesy Nelson for allegedly attempting to look "racially ambiguous" in her music video for her new song Boyz. She said, "Understand, there are white women now trying to appear racially ambiguous because they understand the benefit of appearing like that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leigh-Anne recently starred in a BBC documentary titled, Leigh-Anne: Race, Pop and Power, where she opened up about the racism and colorism she's experienced in the music industry and even in Little Mix as the only black member in the band.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesy Nelson Called Out For 'Cosplaying As A Black Woman' In 'Boyz' Music Video</a></span></p><p>Not to mention, just a couple of days ago, <a href=#>Jesy finally addressed the accusations of Blackfishing</a> in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a> that was published the same day her new track dropped. When asked about it, Jesy explained, "The whole time I was in Little Mix, I never got any of that. And then I came out of [the band] and people all of a sudden we're saying it. I wasn't on social media around that time, so I let my team [deal with it], because that was when I'd just left."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then added, "But I mean, like, I love Black culture. I love Black music. That's all I know; it's what I grew up on. I'm very aware that I'm a white British woman; I've never said that I wasn't."</p><h2 id=39-cutting-jesy-off-39>'Cutting Jesy Off'</h2><p>It's also worth noting that when Jesy announced the release date for Boyz earlier this month, that very same day, Little Mix began promoting their upcoming single titled Cut You Off, which comes in November with the rest of their new album, Between Us.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a short promo video</a>, the girls revealed that writing this song "felt like therapy" as they could get everything off their chest, and many Mixers began connecting the dots speculating that it might be about Jesy leaving the band. Not it seems that all three of them are definitely living up to the song's title, "Cutting Jesy Off," at least on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The girls even shared a snippet of the track on the band's TikTok account with a video of what seemed to be a fan dancing to it. But it turns out that this self-proclaimed Mixer, Raurie Williams, best known as Nohun on socials, went on to do an Instagram live where he shared alleged DMs from Leigh-Anne showing that it was actually Jesy who blocked the girls on the platform.</p><h2 id=leaked-dms>Leaked DMs</h2><p>In the purported receipts, Leigh-Anne says, "She blocked us. Cut us off. Horrible person." This supposedly came after Nohun posted a poll asking if he should also do a dance routine to Jesy's new song, and Leigh-Anne allegedly reached out to him, writing, "Do a video about her being a blackfish instead."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, there's a lot of skepticism surrounding the legitimacy of Nohun's alleged receipts, with fans pointing out key details that just don't add up, suggesting that it could be fake and that he only inserted himself for clout.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesy Nelson Says She Gets Bored Of Nice Guys While Promoting Her Nicki Minaj Collab 'Boyz'</a></span></p><p>And if those DMs are indeed legit, Mixers also called him out, saying that he had no right to share them without Leigh-Anne's consent which may have just been upset at the time. For this reason, she was just venting out about the situation, especially when Nohun himself later shared an Instagram story saying that no one had permission to post screen recording from his IG live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, local artist Corey Sean, who's appeared on The X Factor UK multiple times, defended Leigh-Anne and slammed Jesy in a video that began trending on Twitter. He said, "I respect that Leigh-Anne is out here making a black fund to help black people achieve. What's Jesy Nelson ever done or doing? Nothing. To try to make herself more secure and comfortable by using my culture." Leigh-Anne actually went on to follow Corey on Instagram.</p><h2 id=jesy-nelson-only-follows-two-people-on-instagram>Jesy Nelson Only Follows Two People on Instagram</h2><p>It also must be noted that before the release of her song, Jesy unfollowed everyone on her Instagram except Nicki Minaj and Diddy. At the moment, Little Mix's official Instagram still follows Jesy.</p><p>The Boyz singer had just told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour UK</a> that she hasn't been speaking to the girls since she exited the band aside from a few texts but that she still loves them as sisters. As of yet, none of the girls have addressed this unfolding situation, so fans are just going to have to wait to see what happens next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Mix's Leigh-Anne Tearfully â€˜Addressesâ€™ Nicki Minaj Feud During Her Birthday Party Speech</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4yaqZ5llqq%2FqrvUrGSwoaSdequx0rJkp52cqLyvecGlmJyjlp7AqbXNoGSlnZGrsm64yK2rpZ1dora5ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-fans-are-furious-with-jesy-nelson-blackfishing-leave-little-mix.html&text=Here%27s%20Why%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Furious%20With%20Jesy%20Nelson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-fans-are-furious-with-jesy-nelson-blackfishing-leave-little-mix.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-fans-are-furious-with-jesy-nelson-blackfishing-leave-little-mix.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Furious%20With%20Jesy%20Nelson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-fans-are-furious-with-jesy-nelson-blackfishing-leave-little-mix.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Furious%20With%20Jesy%20Nelson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-fans-are-furious-with-jesy-nelson-blackfishing-leave-little-mix.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Furious%20With%20Jesy%20Nelson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-fans-are-furious-with-jesy-nelson-blackfishing-leave-little-mix.html&description=Here%27s%20Why%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Furious%20With%20Jesy%20Nelson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joel-mchale.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joel Mchale Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Education, Wife, Family, Career and Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./daughter-of-latest-victim-tied-to-gilgo-beach-slay-suspect-breaks-silence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daughter of latest victim tied to Gilgo Beach slay suspect breaks silence">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
