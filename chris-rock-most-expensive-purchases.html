Given his success, it's no surprise he is also one of the wealthiest comedians out there with a net worth estimated at $100 million. He got his start the way many other successful comedians did, by becoming a member of the Saturday Night Live team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chris Rock's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Chris Rock rose to fame alongside other notable comedians like Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, and David Spade. He remains close friends with many of his SNL castmates to this day. From SNL he moved on to films and stand-up comedy tours all over the world, but along the way, he always makes sure he has time to spend some of his well-earned cash. Here are a few of the most expensive things Chris Rock has bought.</p><h2 id=alpine-new-jersey-mansion>10. Alpine, New Jersey Mansion</h2><p>Alpine, New Jersey is a hot spot for celebrity mansions. Chris Rock's home includes famous neighbors like Tracy Morgan, Lil Kim, and Russell Simmons. The mansion is located in the Timberline Estates neighborhood. Even the name sounds fancy.</p><p>It's not surprising that many celebs congregate in this area because it is one of the most expensive places to live in the country and it's very close to New York City. Of the many luxurious accommodations in Rock's home, a few include seven fireplaces, an arcade, six bedrooms, a wrap-around driveway, an in-ground swimming pool, and even multiple kitchens. He purchased the mansion for an estimated $3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brooklyn-townhouse>9. Brooklyn Townhouse</h2><p>Chris Rock has owned this stately Brooklyn townhouse since his Saturday Night Live days in the 1990s. The townhouse is located in a Beaux-Arts building and has a roof patio in addition to a ground-level terrace. He recently decided to part ways with it since he typically doesn't stay there any longer.</p><p>Over the last few years, Rock has rented the house out, preferring to remain at his Alpine mansion instead. The townhouse sold for 3.35 million in January 2018. As for how much he rented it out for over the years, his listings have steadily increased from the original $7,950 to $15,000, according to <a href=#>People</a>.</p><h2 id=rolex-submariner>8. Rolex Submariner</h2><p>If Chris Rock ever asks you for a favor, make sure you say yes. There was a point in time when Rock needed help from friends Tina Fey and Louis CK to rewrite a movie. For their time, he gave them both $5,000 and a Rolex Submariner watch. On the back of each watch was the inscription "thanks motherf*****r."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Watches Made By Rolex That Only The Rich Can Afford</a></span></p><p>These watches are valued at over $7,000, and they're able to last underwater to depths up to 100 meters. Rolex watches are a staple to many celebrities, and the reason is because of their high-quality finish. The Submariner is no different. It sets the standard for diver's watches.</p><h2 id=diamond-accessories>7. Diamond Accessories</h2><p>It's not only women in Hollywood who like to adorn themselves with <a href=#>diamonds</a> and jewelry. Chris Rock is one of many celebrity men who appreciates a tasteful diamond stud. It's rare to see Chris Rock out and about without a pair of diamond studs in his ears. They range in size too, from smaller-sized gemstones to quite large ones.</p><p>Depending on how many carats compose each diamond, these seemingly simple earrings could run the comedian up several thousand dollars, and he's amassed an extensive collection. It has become part of his trademark look. Even when doing stand-up comedy, you'll likely notice the adornments in his ears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-yeezys>6.&nbsp;Yeezys</h2><p>Celebrities take their sneakers super seriously. Chris Rock has an extensive sneaker collection, and he had the chance to add to it while shopping with <a href=#>Complex</a> on their regular series Sneaker Shopping at Stadium Goods in New York City with Joe La Puma. One of Chris Rock's favorite brands is Kanye West's line, Yeezy's.</p><p>He likes to wear them while he's on tour because he feels like they convey a strong presence. Altogether, Rock spent more than $2,000 in this one episode, and that's only when shopping on a whim. If he's an avid collector of Yeezy's, then he has probably spent far more than that to beef up his collection.</p><h2 id=dodge-durango>5. Dodge Durango</h2><p>Chris Rock was apparently so proud of this particular purchase he took to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to share it with his fans. The Dodge Durango is actually not a big splurge for a celebrity. Although the average cost is around $30,000, so it's still plenty expensive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But where most celebrities tend towards more flashy cars like Rolls Royces and Lambos, it's kind of refreshing to see a wealthy guy like Chris Rock is perfectly content with a Durango. Of course, it's not his only vehicle, so it lessens the impact a little once you remember that.</p><h2 id=maserati-maintenance>4. Maserati Maintenance</h2><p>Chris Rock didn't have to buy himself a Maserati, Adam Sandler did that for him. But even though Rock didn't have to shell out the $200,000 price-tag for the car, he did accept the gift and therefore had to pay for the upkeep. When your car is worth several hundred thousand dollars, it doesn't come cheap to make sure it stays well-maintained. According to <a href=#>OSV</a>, Maseratis are actually one of the most expensive cars out there to get repaired.</p><p>He went on the Howard Stern Show to talk about how he walked outside one day to find the Maserati sitting in his driveway and then learned it came from his good friend and fellow comedian, Adam Sandler. It must be nice to have a friend like that!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-sneakers>3.&nbsp;Sneakers</h2><p>We've already established Chris Rock is a fan of Yeezys so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that he is willing to shell out big bucks for all kinds of <a href=#>sneaker brands</a> from Air Jordans and Balenciaga. He was wearing Air Jordans before they made their big comeback, he was photographed wearing them on the cover of one of his first albums.</p><p>In addition to Jordans, Rock has been spotted on several different occasions wearing stylish Balenciaga sneakers. While you may be able to afford Air Jordans, which typically retail for a hundred dollars or so, it's less likely the average person can pay for one thousand dollar Balenciaga shoes.</p><h2 id=eyeglasses>2. Eyeglasses</h2><p>Chris Rock is frequently seen wearing glasses. He wears both sunglasses and eyeglasses on the regular. His glasses are almost always a designer brand. One of his preferred brands is Ic Berlin, which can cost up to $500.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the 2016 Emmy Awards, he wore a pair of Robert Marc eyeglasses. Marc is known for his hand-crafted frames and the utilization of matte finish. Given the frequency of which Rock wears glasses, it makes sense he would be willing to pay top dollar for a good brand. Robert Marc glasses can get pricey fast, even going all the way up to $1,000.</p><h2 id=sports-games>1. Sports Games</h2><p>Everyone needs a hobby, and plenty of celebrities embrace sports the same way your average, everyday American does. Although you probably won't catch your next door neighbor sitting court-side at the NBA Finals like Chris Rock. Did you know that some fans have paid more than $100,000 those dream seats?</p><p>Rock is also partial to the New York Knicks basketball team. He spends a large amount of money every year to go to basketball games and sometimes he brings other people with him. The price of admission to attend multiple games annually is probably costing Chris Rock a substantial amount.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Basketball Players In The World</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqb7IrGSrp5Ogeq670q1knrCgmru0tdWeZKmtopi1or%2FErGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-rock-most-expensive-purchases.html&text=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Things%20Chris%20Rock%20Has%20Bought&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-rock-most-expensive-purchases.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-rock-most-expensive-purchases.html&title=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Things%20Chris%20Rock%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-rock-most-expensive-purchases.html&title=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Things%20Chris%20Rock%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-rock-most-expensive-purchases.html&title=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Things%20Chris%20Rock%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-rock-most-expensive-purchases.html&description=10%20Most%20Expensive%20Things%20Chris%20Rock%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-american-idol-go-bankrupt-in-2016.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did American Idol Go Bankrupt In 2016?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./khia-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Khia Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
