When author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first introduced the character in his novel A Study In Scarlet, he had no idea he was laying down the foundation for one of the most endearing detective series ever written. He also had no way of knowing that the character would maintain his popularity for over 100 years! So popular was the character when he was first introduced that when Doyle tried to retire the character by killing him off, the public was so outraged that he was brought back to life in another novel. The incident where Holmes "faked" his death is now a classic part of the character's story arc and has been adapted as part of the Sherlock Holmes canon, along with his tobacco addiction, violin playing, and his notoriously poor social skills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch's Heartwarming Friendship With 'Sherlock' Co-Star Una Stubbs</a></span></p><p>Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes have ranged from the comical to the dramatic and there have been hundreds of radio plays, stage plays, television shows, and movies, all thanks to the 5 novels and endless amount of short stories that gave us the pipe-smoking, hawk-nosed detective. The oldest existing footage of a Sherlock Holmes film is the 1900 silent film Sherlock Holmes Baffled and the actor in the film is unknown. <a href=#>It would be nearly impossible</a> to list all of the actors who have played Sherlock over the last 100+ years, so we will focus on some of the most recent and noteworthy, and see just who is the richest to play everyone's favorite tenant of 221B Baker Street.</p><h2 id=louis-hector---1-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Louis Hector - $1 Million</span></h2><p>www.youtube.com/watch?v=40T5jCota7k</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Out of respect, we must acknowledge <a href=#>the first man to ever play the detective on television</a>. Hector played the detective in a movie called The Three Garridebs made for NBC in 1937.</p><h2 id=sir-basil-rathbone---1-5-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Sir Basil Rathbone - $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Next to Cumberbach, Rathbone is probably the most iconic actor to have played Sherlock Holmes, and he was certainly the one who did it the most. He played the detective more than a dozen times and first played him in the classic 1939 version of The Hound of The Baskervilles.</p><h2 id=alan-napier---1-5-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Alan Napier - $1.5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>AKA Alfred Pennyworth in the Adam West Batman series, the accomplished British actor also played Holmes in 1949. He was in the adaptation of the Holmes short story The Speckled Band.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Sherlock Holmes 3': How Robert Downey Jr. Feels About Johnny Depp Being The Villain</a></span></p><h2 id=milton-berle---2-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Milton Berle - $2 Million</span></h2><p>The comedy legend played the detective only once, but it is noteworthy for being one of the first American television versions of Holmes. He played the character in an episode of Texaco Star Theater in 1949.</p><h2 id=boris-karloff---5-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Boris Karloff - $5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The man who brought Frankensteinâ€™s monster to life played Holmes in an episode of The Elgin Hour in 1955. The episode was an adaptation of the Holmes story, A Taste For Honey.</p><h2 id=peter-cushing---10-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Peter Cushing - $10 Million</span></h2><p>Fans of Star Wars might be interested to know that the man who played Grand Moff Tarkin also played Sherlock Holmes a few times for both television and film. For example, he played the detective in the 1959 film adaptation of The Hound of The Baskervilles, one of the most popular of the original novels.</p><h2 id=johnny-lee-miller---14-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Johnny Lee Miller - $14 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elementary lasted for seven seasons and the Americanized version of the detective was played by Johnny Lee Miller. The show turned his sidekick, John Watson, into a woman named Joan Watson, who was played by Lucy Liu.</p><h2 id=henry-cavil---40-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Henry Cavil - $40 Million</span></h2><p>Yes, Superman was also Sherlock Holmes once, and unlike every other Sherlock interpretation, he was not the main character or even the hero. In <a href=#>Enola Holmes</a>, Sherlockâ€™s sister tries to one-up him and show she is the real detective of the family. The film came out in 2020. Millie Bobbie Brown plays the detective's plucky little sister.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch---40-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Benedict Cumberbatch - $40 Million</span></h2><p>The most famous version of Sherlock in recent memory. Cumberbatch brought the character to life <a href=#>in the groundbreaking BBC series</a>. The show was a modernized version of the detective and the show was steeped in realism, and it was one of the only times the characters acknowledged that Holmes was autistic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch And Martin Freeman: Which 'Sherlock' Star Has The Higher Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=sir-ian-mckellen---60-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sir Ian McKellen - $60 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He only played the detective once on the silver screen, but the X-Men star was exemplary as an elderly version of the detective in Mr. Holmes. It is arguably one of the more underrated interpretations of the character. We usually see Holmes as a young or middle-aged man, never in his autumn years.</p><h2 id=will-ferrell---160-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Will Ferrell - $160 Million</span></h2><p>Will Ferrell did a comedy version of Sherlock with his pal John C. Reilly as Watson in the 2018 movie, Holmes and Watson. The film was critically panned and a total flop.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr---300-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Robert Downey Jr - $300 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It shouldnâ€™t come as a shock that RDJ is the wealthiest actor so far to play Sherlock Holmes. One of the few times when an American is cast to play a British character, RDJâ€™s work in the Guy Richie film adaptations Sherlock Holmes and A Game of Shadows was very well reviewed.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> 'Sherlock' Fans Still Think The Show Will Have A Fifth Season</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnKyfp8Buw8eoZKmkka6ypXnSoZyrpJ%2BYuG60zqWknqtdp66vt8SdZJuxXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2factors-who-played-sherlock-holmes-ranked-by-net-worth.html&text=The%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Played%20Sherlock%20Holmes%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2factors-who-played-sherlock-holmes-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2factors-who-played-sherlock-holmes-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Played%20Sherlock%20Holmes%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2factors-who-played-sherlock-holmes-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Played%20Sherlock%20Holmes%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2factors-who-played-sherlock-holmes-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Played%20Sherlock%20Holmes%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2factors-who-played-sherlock-holmes-ranked-by-net-worth.html&description=The%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Played%20Sherlock%20Holmes%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alex-warren-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Warren  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./steven-weber-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steven Weber  Bio (Wiki) ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
