The couple appeared head-over-heels. Pete got several tattoos dedicated to Kim and her kids, and he even appeared on The Kardashians.</p><p>However, the couple were plagued by harassment from Kim’s ex-husband Kanye West. Pete became the subject of many of his online tirades. Ye encouraged his fans to scream at Pete if they saw him in public, and even released an animated music video of himself burying a likeness of Pete alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>18 Celebrity Couples Who Surprisingly Eloped</a></span></p><p>Pete and Kim eventually split in August 2022, amid reports of conflicting schedules.

Both celebrities are known to keep their personal life under wraps, but sources have confirmed they’re dating. But it seems more casual than anything, and maybe not exclusive. “[They are] seeing each other," one source told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-haven-rsquo-t-been-shy-to-show-pda><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Haven’t Been Shy To Show PDA</span></h2><p>One thing that’s for sure is that Pete and Emily aren’t just friends. They may not have commented on their relationship status yet, but they’re not shy to show PDA in public. The paparazzi have photographed them on numerous occasions holding hands and locking lips, proving that these two are definitely into each other.</p><h2 id=they-rsquo-ve-already-been-dating-for-a-few-months><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They’ve Already Been Dating For A Few Months</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete and Emily were first linked in November 2022, but they may have been seeing each other for a lot longer.

It’s unclear of the custody arrangement between Emily and her ex.</p><p>But Pete has talked about wanting to have kids himself and was spotted hanging out one-on-one with Kim’s kids during their relationship. So, the fact that the model has a child likely is no problem for the comedian. It’s likely just a matter of time before he’s introduced to Emily’s son.</p><h2 id=pete-feels-challenged-by-emily><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Pete Feels Challenged By Emily</span></h2><p>The relationship may be easy-going right now, but Pete apparently feels challenged by his new girlfriend, sources say. “Pete and Emily just dig each other and find the vibe they have very easy and free-flowing,” an insider told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “There’s no intensity or over-expectation on either side, just a lot of fun and a chance to cut loose and see where it leads.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They added, “There’s no doubt Pete loves a challenge and he’s certainly met his intellectual match in Emily.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnq6Voa61tc6nqmaZkqTCtXnPnqueZZSWw6qw0qilZp2dnrm6edGaq5qim6TEtLfIZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frevelations-about-pete-davidson-emily-ratajkowski-relationship.html&text=10%20Revelations%20About%20Pete%20Davidson%20%26amp%3b%20Emily%20Ratajkowski%27s%20New%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frevelations-about-pete-davidson-emily-ratajkowski-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frevelations-about-pete-davidson-emily-ratajkowski-relationship.html&title=10%20Revelations%20About%20Pete%20Davidson%20%26amp%3b%20Emily%20Ratajkowski%27s%20New%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frevelations-about-pete-davidson-emily-ratajkowski-relationship.html&title=10%20Revelations%20About%20Pete%20Davidson%20%26amp%3b%20Emily%20Ratajkowski%27s%20New%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frevelations-about-pete-davidson-emily-ratajkowski-relationship.html&title=10%20Revelations%20About%20Pete%20Davidson%20%26amp%3b%20Emily%20Ratajkowski%27s%20New%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frevelations-about-pete-davidson-emily-ratajkowski-relationship.html&description=10%20Revelations%20About%20Pete%20Davidson%20%26amp%3b%20Emily%20Ratajkowski%27s%20New%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bhad-bhabie-interesting-facts-about-her-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bhad Bhabie | Interesting Facts About Her Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vanderpump-rules-recap-lisas-designer-body-shames-katie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Vanderpump Rules' Recap: Lisas Designer Body-Shames Katie">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
